title: Smart MVC Razor Pages
slug: netcore-razor

Driven by our preference for [API-first style of Web Development](/api-first-development)
we've developed our own [ServiceStack Razor Pages](http://razor.netcore.io) which lets you develop dynamic
Web Pages using Razor to generate the HTML view of your existing Services - saving you from maintaining a 
parallel Controller implementation that's limited to just Web Pages. The benefits of an API-first
approach is that you'll naturally get a well-defined servicified interface which can be consumed by all 
consumers including Web, Native Mobile and Desktop Apps whilst also enabling simplified B2B Integrations, 
Automation, Integration testing, etc.

### RazorFormat Usage

You can find .NET Core Razor features documented in [razor.netcore.io](http://razor.netcore.io) which 
is maintained in our MVC NuGet package that can be installed with: 

::: nuget
`<PackageReference Include="ServiceStack.Mvc" Version="5.*" />`
:::


Then to enable, register the `RazorFormat` plugin:

```csharp
public override void Configure(Container container)
{
    Plugins.Add(new RazorFormat());
}
```

#### [No Ceremony Dynamic Pages without Controllers](http://razor.netcore.io/#no-ceremony)

In a lot of cases where you're not developing Web Forms accepting User Input (e.g. generating a dynamic 
page using simple page-specific db queries) you won't need a Controller or Service at all. 
For this scenario we developed [Controller-less Razor Pages](http://razor.netcore.io/#smart-views), 
where if you specify a Typed `@model`, ServiceStack automatically populates it from the HTTP Request Params 
and when no `@model` exists ServiceStack instead populates the Request params in a `ViewDataDictionary` - 
in both cases letting you access any Request Params using **@Model.Name** notation.

Razor Pages also lets you layout your Razor Views in whatever structure you want under `/wwwroot` 
which it will let you call using [Pretty URLs by default](http://razor.netcore.io/#no-ceremony) so you're 
not led into following the MVC-specific `{Controller}/{Action}` pattern or made to define Custom Routes.

.NET Core Razor Pages implementation also lets you structure your Razor Pages under `/Views/Pages` as an 
alternative to maintaining them under `/wwwroot`.

### MVC Razor Pages

Unfortunately in .NET Core we weren't able to reuse any of our existing **ServiceStack.Razor** implementation,
but as we found the development model and end-user experience of Razor without MVC Controllers and Actions 
much more productive we investigated how it could best be implemented in .NET Core. Unfortunately 
.NET Core's Razor support is tightly coupled to MVC's implementation, but fortunately for us MVC also 
provided the necessary APIs where we could re-implement ServiceStack.Razor's user-facing features using 
just MVC Razor Views. 

In many ways this turned out to be a blessing in disguise as by using MVC's implementation we also get 
access to new MVC .NET Core features and its surrounding ecosystem like Tag Helpers. MVC also takes care 
of live-reloading Razor Views behind-the-scenes so we're also able to get the same iterative development 
experience we're used to. By using MVC Views we also naturally get good tooling support which 
[can be a dark art in .NET 4.5](https://docs.servicestack.net/razor-notes.html)
which was tightly coupled to **Web.config** configuration and therefore poorly supported in Self-Hosting 
Console Apps. 

> Currently ReSharper's tooling has issues with Razor Views inheriting Custom base classes - 
which can be resolved by installing the latest EAP or disabling its **ASP.NET Razor** support.

Overall we're ecstatic with the end-result, we retain our Controller-free development model whilst Razor under 
.NET Core executes noticeably quicker than ASP.NET and significantly faster on Linux vs using Mono.

## Page Based Routing in Razor!

Another value-added feature of ServiceStack.Razor is support for Page Based Routing in [ASP.NET Core Razor](/netcore-razor) 
which lets you use a `_` prefix to declare a variable placeholder for dynamic routes defined solely by directory and file names.

With this feature we can use a `_id` directory name to declare an `id` variable place holder:

 - [/contacts/_id/edit.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/Validation/blob/master/world/wwwroot/server-razor/contacts/_id/edit.cshtml)

This will let you navigate to the `edit.cshtml` page directly to edit a contact using the ideal "pretty url" we want:

 - [/contacts/1/edit](http://validation.web-app.io/server-razor/contacts/1/edit)

Placeholders can be on both directory or file names, e.g:

 - `/contacts/edit/_id.cshtml` -> **/contacts/edit/1**

Inside your Razor page you can fetch any populated placeholders from the `ViewBag`:

```csharp
var id = int.Parse(ViewBag.id);
var contact = Html.Exec(() => Gateway.Send(new GetContact { Id = id }).Result, out var error);
```

Which [/_id/edit.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/Validation/blob/master/world/wwwroot/server-razor/contacts/_id/edit.cshtml) 
uses to call the `GetContact` Service using the [Service Gateway](/service-gateway).

> `Html.Exec()` is a UX-friendly alternative to using `try/catch` boilerplate in Razor

### Stand-alone Razor Views

Rendering stand-alone HTML Views from Razor Pages can use the `GetViewPage()` API for retrieving View Pages 
(e.g. under `~/Views`) and the `GetContentPage()` API for retrieving Content Pages (e.g. under `/wwwroot`). 

You can then use `RenderToHtmlAsync()` API to render the HTML output in a UTF-8 `ReadOnlyMemory<char>` which your Services can return directly 
for optimal efficiency, or if needed the rendered output can be converted to a `string` with `.ToString()`:

```csharp
public async Task<object> Any(MyRequest request)
{
    var razor = GetPlugin<RazorFormat>();
    var view = razor.GetViewPage("MyView");
    if (view == null)
        throw HttpError.NotFound("Razor view not found: " + "MyView");

    var ret = await razor.RenderToHtmlAsync(view, new MyModel { Name = "World" },
        layout:"_MyLayout"); //if Layout specified in `.cshtml` page it uses that
    return ret;
}
```

For even better efficiency the Razor View can render to the Response `OutputStream` directly with `WriteHtmlAsync()` to write the rendered UTF-8 bytes 
directly to the `OutputStream` instead of above where it converts it into a UTF-8 string before converting it back to UTF-8 bytes when ServiceStack
writes it to the response:

```csharp
public async Task Any(MyRequest request)
{
    var razor = GetPlugin<RazorFormat>();
    var view = razor.GetViewPage("MyView");
    if (view == null)
        throw HttpError.NotFound("Razor view not found: " + "MyView");

    await razor.WriteHtmlAsync(Response.OutputStream, view, 
        new MyModel { Name = "World" }, 
        layout:"_MyLayout"); //if Layout specified in `.cshtml` page it uses that
}
```

If needed you can also render the view with an anonymous Model Type, e.g:

```csharp
await razor.RenderToHtmlAsync(view, new { Name = "World" });
```

Where the Razor View would need to specify it's using a `dynamic` model with:

```html
@model dynamic
```

#### Limitation

One drawback of page based routing is that MVC is unable to resolve Page Based Routes when pre-compiled and will need to disabled with:

#### .NET Core 3+

```xml
<RazorCompileOnPublish>false</RazorCompileOnPublish>
```

#### .NET Core 2.x

```xml
<MvcRazorCompileOnPublish>false</MvcRazorCompileOnPublish>
```
