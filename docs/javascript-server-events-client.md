Like ServiceStack's other JavaScript interop libraries, the client bindings for ServiceStack's Server Events is in ServiceStack's JavaScript client bindings [/js/ss-utils.js](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/js/ss-utils.js) that's embedded in `ServiceStack.dll` and available from any page with:

```html
<script src="/js/ss-utils.js"></script>
```

To configure Server Sent Events on the client create a [native EventSource object](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/) with:

```javascript
var source = new EventSource(
    '/event-stream?channel=channel&t=' + new Date().getTime());
```

> The default url `/event-stream` can be modified with `ServerEventsFeature.StreamPath`

As this is the native `EventSource` object, you can interact with it directly, e.g. you can add custom error handlers with:

```javascript
source.addEventListener('error', function (e) { 
        console.log("ERROR!", e); 
    }, false);
```

The ServiceStack binding itself is just a thin jQuery plugin that extends `EventSource`, e.g:

```javascript
$(source).handleServerEvents({
    handlers: {
        onConnect: function (sub) {
            console.log("You've connected! welcome " + sub.displayName);
        },
        onJoin: function (user) {
            console.log("Welcome, " + user.displayName);
        },
        onLeave: function (user) {
            console.log(user.displayName + " has left the building");
        },        
        onMessage: function (msg, e) { // fired after every message
            console.log(msg);
        },
        //... Register custom handlers
    },
    receivers: { 
        //... Register any receivers
    },
});
```

ServiceStack Server Events has 4 built-in events sent during a subscriptions life-cycle: 

 - **onConnect** - sent when successfully connected, includes the subscriptions private `subscriptionId` as well as heartbeat and unregister urls that's used to automatically setup periodic heartbeats.
 - **onJoin** - sent when a new user joins the channel.
 - **onLeave** - sent when a user leaves the channel.
 - **onUpdate** - sent when a users channels subscription was updated

> The onJoin/onLeave/onUpdate events can be turned off with `ServerEventsFeature.NotifyChannelOfSubscriptions=false`.

All other messages can be handled with the catch-all:

 - **onMessage** - fired when any other message is sent

## Selectors

A selector is a string that identifies what should handle the message, it's used by the client to route the message to different handlers. The client bindings in [/js/ss-utils.js](https://github.com/ServiceStack/EmailContacts/#servicestack-javascript-utils---jsss-utilsjs) supports 4 different handlers out of the box:

### Global Event Handlers

To recap [Declarative Events](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/EmailContacts#declarative-events) allow you to define global handlers on a html page which can easily be applied on any element by decorating it with `data-{event}='{handler}'` attribute, eliminating the need to do manual bookkeeping of DOM events. 

The example below first invokes the `paintGreen` handler when the button is clicked and fires the `paintRed` handler when the button loses focus:

```javascript
$(document).bindHandlers({
    paintGreen: function(){
        $(this).css("background","green");
    }, 
    paintRed: function(){
        $(this).css("background","red");
    }, 
});
```

```html
<button id="btnPaint" data-click="paintGreen" data-focusout="paintRed">
    Paint Town
</button>
```

The selector to invoke a global event handler is:

    cmd.{handler}

Where `{handler}` is the name of the handler you want to invoke, e.g `cmd.paintGreen`. When invoked from a server event the message (deserialized from JSON) is the first argument, the Server Sent DOM Event is the 2nd argument and `this` by default is assigned to `document.body`.

```javascript
function paintGreen(msg /* JSON object msg */, e /*SSE Event*/){
    this // HTML Element or document.body
    $(this).css("background","green");
},
```


#### Handling Messages with the Default Selector

All `IServerEvents` Notify API's includes [overloads for sending messages without a selector](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/ServerEventsFeature.cs#L743-L771) that by convention will take the format `cmd.{TypeName}`. 

As they're prefixed with `cmd.*` these events can be handled with a handler **based on Message type name**, e.g:

```javascript
$(source).handleServerEvents({
    handlers: {
        CustomType: function (msg, e) { ... },
        SetterType: function (msg, e) { ... }
    },
});
```

Which will be called when messages are sent without a selector, e.g:

```csharp
public class MyServices : Service
{
    public IServerEvents ServerEvents { get; set; }

    public void Any(Request request)
    {
        ServerEvents.NotifyChannel("home", new CustomType { ... });
        ServerEvents.NotifyChannel("home", new SetterType { ... });
    }
}
```

### Postfix jQuery selector 

All server event handler options also support a postfix jQuery selector for specifying what each handler should be bound to with a `$` followed by the jQuery selector, e.g:

    cmd.{handler}${jQuerySelector}

A concrete example for calling the above API would be:

    cmd.paintGreen$#btnPaint

Which will bind `this` to the `#btnSubmit` HTML Element, retaining the same behavior as if it were called with `data-click="paintGreen"`.

> Note: Spaces in jQuery selectors need to be encoded with `%20`

### Modifying CSS via jQuery

As it's a popular use-case Server Events also has native support for modifying CSS properties with:

    css.{propertyName}${jQuerySelector} {propertyValue}

Where the message is the property value, which roughly translates to:

    $({jQuerySelector}).css({propertyName}, {propertyValue})

When no jQuery selector is specified it falls back to `document.body` by default.

    /css.background #eceff1

Some other examples include:

    /css.background$#top #673ab7   // $('#top').css('background','#673ab7')
    /css.font$li bold 12px verdana // $('li').css('font','bold 12px verdana')
    /css.visibility$a,img hidden   // $('a,img').css('visibility','#673ab7')
    /css.visibility$a%20img hidden // $('a img').css('visibility','hidden')

### jQuery Events

A popular approach in building loosely-coupled applications is to have components interact with each other by raising events. It's similar to channels in Pub/Sub where interested parties can receive and process custom events on components they're listening on. jQuery supports this model by simulating DOM events that can be raised with [$.trigger()](http://api.jquery.com/trigger/). 

You can subscribe to custom events in the same way as normal DOM events, e.g:

```javascript
$(document).on('customEvent', function(event, arg, msgEvent){
    var target = event.target;
});
```

The selector to trigger this event is:

    trigger.customEvent arg
    trigger.customEvent$#btnPaint arg

Where if no jQuery selector is specified it defaults to `document`. These selectors are equivalent to:

```javascript
$(document).trigger('customEvent', 'arg')
$("#btnPaint").trigger('customEvent', 'arg')
```

### Receivers

In programming languages based on message-passing like Smalltalk and Objective-C invoking a method is done by sending a message to a receiver. This is conceptually equivalent to invoking a method on an instance in C# where both these statements are roughly equivalent:

```objc
// Objective-C
[receiver method:argument]
```

```csharp
// C#
receiver.method(argument)
```

Support for receivers is available in the following format:

    {receiver}.{target} {msg}

### Registering Receivers

Registering a receiver can be either be done by adding it to the global `$.ss.eventReceivers` map with the object instance and the name you want it to be exported as. E.g. The `window` and `document` global objects can be setup to receive messages with:

```javascript
$.ss.eventReceivers = { 
    "window": window, 
    "document": document 
};
```

Once registered you can set any property or call any method on a receiver with:

    document.title New Window Title
    window.location http://google.com

Where if `{target}` was a function it will be invoked with the message, otherwise its property will be set.
By default when no `{jQuerySelector}` is defined, `this` is bound to the **receiver** instance.

The alternative way to register a receiver is at registration with:

```javascript
$(source).handleServerEvents({
  ...
  receivers: {
    tv: {
      watch: function (id) {
        if (id.indexOf('youtu.be') >= 0) {
            var v = $.ss.splitOnLast(id, '/')[1];
            $("#tv").html(templates.youtube.replace("{id}", v)).show();
        } else {
            $("#tv").html(templates.generic.replace("{id}", id)).show();
        }
      },
      off: function () {
        $("#tv").hide().html("");
      }
   }
}
});
```

This registers a custom `tv` receiver that can now be called with:

    tv.watch http://youtu.be/518XP8prwZo
    tv.watch https://servicestack.net/img/logo-220.png
    tv.off

### Un Registering a Receiver

As receivers are maintained in a simple map, they can be disabled at anytime with:

```javascript
$.ss.eventReceivers["window"] = null; 
```

and re-enabled with:

```javascript
$.ss.eventReceivers["window"] = window;
```

Whilst Named Receivers are used to handle messages sent to a specific namespaced selector, the client also supports registering a **Global Receiver** for handling messages sent with the special `cmd.*` selector.

### UpdateSubscriber APIs

You can use any of the APIs below in the
[ss-utils JavaScript library](/ss-utils-js)
to update an active Subscriptions Channels:

```javascript
$.ss.updateSubscriber({ 
    SubscribeChannels: "chan1,chan2",
    UnsubscribeChannels: "chan3,chan4"
});

$.ss.subscribeToChannels(["chan1","chan2"], response => ..., error => ...);
$.ss.unsubscribeFromChannels(["chan3","chan4"], response => ..., error => ...);
```
