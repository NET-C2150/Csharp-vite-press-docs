## Debug Links

To provide better visibility to the hidden functionality in ServiceStack we've added **Debug Info** links section to the `/metadata` page which add links to any Plugins with Web UI's, e.g:

![Debug Info Links](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/release-notes/debug-links.png)

The Debug Links section is only available in **DebugMode** (recap: set by default in Debug builds or explicitly with `Config.DebugMode = true`). In addition, users with the **Admin** role (or if `Config.AdminAuthSecret` is enabled) can also view the debug Plugins UI's in production.

You can add links to your own [Plugins](/plugins) in the metadata pages with:

```csharp
appHost.GetPlugin<MetadataFeature>().AddPluginLink("swagger-ui/", "Swagger UI");
appHost.GetPlugin<MetadataFeature>().AddDebugLink("?debug=requestinfo", "Request Info");
```

`AddPluginLink` adds links under the **Plugin Links** section and should be used if your plugin is publicly visible, otherwise use `AddDebugLink` for plugins only available during debugging or development.

## [Auto Mapping](/auto-mapping)

#### Improved Support for non-POCO types
Previously you could only map between top-level POCO models, now you can map between scalars and collections directly, e.g:

```csharp
var intVal = 2L.ConvertTo<int>();
var decimalVal = 4.4d.ConvertTo<decimal>();
var usersSet = new[] { new User(1), new User(2) }.ConvertTo<HashSet<User>>();
```

#### Improved Auto-Mapping Performance

A better caching strategy is used for conversions paths and now mapping fields utilize cached Delegate expressions so POCO's with fields Map much faster. 

## Async Support

#### Consistent handling of Async Responses

Previously Response Filters were called with the Task response returned from async services for the Response DTO, e.g. `Task<TResponse>`. The response filters are now chained to the task so Response filters see the same native `TResponse` DTO that are passed in from Sync services.

#### Async services can now be used in MQ Servers

Async responses now block for results which is in-line with sync Services behavior where Message Queue Handlers only process one message at a time for each worker thread assigned to the Request type.

## NuGet packages specify min versions

To ensure NuGet pulls the latest dependencies when installing any ServiceStack package, a minimum version is now specified for all NuGet package dependencies. This [should alleviate dependency issues](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21670294/85785) people are seeing from NuGet's default behavior of pulling down old packages.
