## Highly Available Redis

[Redis Sentinel](http://redis.io/topics/sentinel) is the official recommendation for running a highly 
available Redis configuration by running a number of additional redis sentinel processes to actively monitor 
existing redis master and slave instances ensuring they're each working as expected. If by consensus it's
determined that the master is no longer available it will automatically failover and promote one of the 
replicated slaves as the new master. The sentinels also maintain an authoritative list of available 
redis instances providing clients a centeral repositorty to discover available instances they can connect to.

Support for Redis Sentinel has been added with the `RedisSentinel` class which listens to the available 
Sentinels to source its list of available master, slave and other sentinel redis instances which it uses
to configure and maintain the Redis Client Managers, initiating any failovers as they're reported.

### RedisSentinel Usage

To use the new Sentinel support, instead of populating the Redis Client Managers with the connection string 
of the master and slave instances you would create a single `RedisSentinel` instance configured with 
the connection string of the running Redis Sentinels:

```csharp
var sentinelHosts = new[]{ "sentinel1", "sentinel2:6390", "sentinel3" };
var sentinel = new RedisSentinel(sentinelHosts, masterName: "mymaster");
```

This shows a typical example of configuring a `RedisSentinel` which references 3 sentinel hosts (i.e. 
the minimum number for a highly available setup which can survive any node failing). 
It's also configured to look at the `mymaster` configuration set (the default master group). 

> Redis Sentinels can monitor more than 1 master / slave group, each with a different master group name. 

The default port for sentinels is **26379** (when unspecified) and as RedisSentinel can auto-discover 
other sentinels, the minimum configuration required is just: 

```csharp
var sentinel = new RedisSentinel("sentinel1");
```

> Scanning and auto discovering of other Sentinels can be disabled with `ScanForOtherSentinels=false`

### Start monitoring Sentinels

Once configured, you can start monitoring the Redis Sentinel servers and access the pre-configured
client manager with:

```csharp
IRedisClientsManager redisManager = sentinel.Start();
```

Which as before, can be registered in your preferred IOC as a **singleton** instance:

```csharp
container.Register<IRedisClientsManager>(c => sentinel.Start());
```

### Advanced Sentinel Configuration

RedisSentinel by default manages a configured `PooledRedisClientManager` instance which resolves both master 
Redis clients for read/write `GetClient()` and slaves for readonly `GetReadOnlyClient()` API's. 

This can be changed to use the newer `RedisManagerPool` with:

```csharp
sentinel.RedisManagerFactory = (master,slaves) => new RedisManagerPool(master);
```

### Custom Redis Connection String

The host the RedisSentinel is configured with only applies to that Sentinel Host, you can still use the flexibility of 
[Redis Connection Strings](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis#redis-connection-strings)
to configure the individual Redis Clients by specifying a custom `HostFilter`:

```csharp
sentinel.HostFilter = host => "{0}?db=1&RetryTimeout=5000".Fmt(host);
```

This will return clients configured to use Database 1 and a Retry Timeout of 5 seconds (used in new 
Auto Retry feature).

### Other RedisSentinel Configuration

Whilst the above covers the popular Sentinel configuration that would typically be used, nearly every aspect
of `RedisSentinel` behavior is customizable with the configuration below:

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <td><b>OnSentinelMessageReceived</b></td><td>Fired when the Sentinel worker receives a message from the Sentinel Subscription</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>OnFailover</b></td><td>Fired when Sentinel fails over the Redis Client Manager to a new master</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>OnWorkerError</b></td><td>Fired when the Redis Sentinel Worker connection fails</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>IpAddressMap</b></td><td>Map internal redis host IP's returned by Sentinels to its external IP</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>ScanForOtherSentinels</b></td><td>Whether to routinely scan for other sentinel hosts (default true)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>RefreshSentinelHostsAfter</b></td><td>What interval to scan for other sentinel hosts (default 10 mins)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>WaitBetweenFailedHosts</b></td><td>How long to wait after failing before connecting to next redis instance (default 250ms)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>MaxWaitBetweenFailedHosts</b></td><td>How long to retry connecting to hosts before throwing (default 60s)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>WaitBeforeForcingMasterFailover</b></td><td>How long after consecutive failed attempts to force failover (default 60s)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>ResetWhenSubjectivelyDown</b></td><td>Reset clients when Sentinel reports redis is subjectively down (default true)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>ResetWhenObjectivelyDown</b></td><td>Reset clients when Sentinel reports redis is objectively down (default true)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>SentinelWorkerConnectTimeoutMs</b></td><td>The Max Connection time for Sentinel Worker (default 100ms)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>SentinelWorkerSendTimeoutMs</b></td><td>Max TCP Socket Send time for Sentinel Worker (default 100ms)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>SentinelWorkerReceiveTimeoutMs</b></td><td>Max TCP Socket Receive time for Sentinel Worker (default 100ms)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## [Configure Redis Sentinel Servers](https://github.com/ServiceStack/redis-config)

[![Instant Redis Setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/redis/instant-sentinel-setup.png)](https://github.com/ServiceStack/redis-config)

We've also created the 
[redis config project](https://github.com/ServiceStack/redis-config) 
to simplify setting up and running a highly-available multi-node Redis Sentinel configuration including 
start/stop scripts for instantly setting up the minimal 
[highly available Redis Sentinel configuration](https://github.com/ServiceStack/redis-config/blob/master/README.md#3x-sentinels-monitoring-1x-master-and-2x-slaves)
on a single (or multiple) Windows, OSX or Linux servers. This single-server/multi-process configuration 
is ideal for setting up a working sentinel configuration on a single dev workstation or remote server.

The redis-config repository also includes the 
[MS OpenTech Windows redis binaries](https://github.com/ServiceStack/redis-windows#running-microsofts-native-port-of-redis)
and doesn't require any software installation. 

### Windows Usage 

To run the included Sentinel configuration, clone the redis-config repo on the server you want to run it on:

    git clone https://github.com/ServiceStack/redis-config.git

Then Start 1x Master, 2x Slaves and 3x Sentinel redis-servers with:

    cd redis-config\sentinel3\windows
    start-all.cmd

Shutdown started instances:

    stop-all.cmd

If you're running the redis processes locally on your dev workstation the minimal configuration to connect 
to the running instances is just:

```csharp
var sentinel = new RedisSentinel("127.0.0.1:26380");
container.Register(c => sentinel.Start());
```

### Localhost vs Network IP's

The sentinel configuration assumes all redis instances are running locally on **127.0.0.1**. 
If you're instead running it on a remote server that you want all developers in your network to be 
able to access, you'll need to either change the IP Address in the `*.conf` files to use the servers 
Network IP. Otherwise you can leave the defaults and use the `RedisSentinel` IP Address Map feature
to transparently map localhost IP's to the Network IP that each pc on your network can connect to.

E.g. if this is running on a remote server with a **10.0.0.9** Network IP, it can be configured with:

```csharp
var sentinel = new RedisSentinel("10.0.0.9:26380") {
    IpAddressMap = {
        {"127.0.0.1", "10.0.0.9"},
    }
};
container.Register(c => sentinel.Start());
```

### Google Cloud - [Click to Deploy Redis](https://github.com/ServiceStack/redis-config/blob/master/README.md#google-cloud---click-to-deploy-redis)

The easiest Cloud Service we've found that can instantly set up a multi node-Redis Sentinel Configuration 
is using Google Cloud's 
[click to deploy Redis feature](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/redis/click-to-deploy) 
available from the Google Cloud Console under **Deploy & Manage**:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/redis/sentinel3-gcloud-01.png)

Clicking **Deploy** button will let you configure the type, size and location where you want to deploy the 
Redis VM's. See the 
[full Click to Deploy Redis guide](https://github.com/ServiceStack/redis-config/blob/master/README.md#google-cloud---click-to-deploy-redis)
for a walk-through on setting up and inspecting a highly-available redis configuration on Google Cloud.

## Automatic Retries

Another feature we've added to improve reliability is Auto Retry where the RedisClient will transparently 
retry failed Redis operations due to Socket and I/O Exceptions in an exponential backoff starting from 
**10ms** up until the `RetryTimeout` of **3000ms**. These defaults can be tweaked with:

```csharp
RedisConfig.DefaultRetryTimeout = 3000;
RedisConfig.BackOffMultiplier = 10;
```

The `RetryTimeout` can also be configured on the connection string with `?RetryTimeout=3000`.

## RedisConfig

The `RedisConfig` static class has been expanded to provide an alternative to Redis Connection Strings to 
configure the default RedisClient settings. Each config option is 
[documented on the RedisConfig class](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Redis/RedisConfig.cs)
with the defaults shown below:

```csharp
class RedisConfig
{
    DefaultConnectTimeout = -1
    DefaultSendTimeout = -1
    DefaultReceiveTimeout = -1
    DefaultRetryTimeout = 3 * 1000
    DefaultIdleTimeOutSecs = 240
    BackOffMultiplier = 10
    BufferLength = 1450
    BufferPoolMaxSize = 500000
    VerifyMasterConnections = true
    HostLookupTimeoutMs = 200
    AssumeServerVersion = null
    DeactivatedClientsExpiry = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)
    DisableVerboseLogging = false
}
```

One option you may want to set is `AssumeServerVersion` with the version of Redis Server version you're running, e.g:

```csharp
RedisConfig.AssumeServerVersion = 2812; //2.8.12
RedisConfig.AssumeServerVersion = 3030; //3.0.3
```

This is used to change the behavior of a few API's to use the most optimal Redis Operation for their server 
version. Setting this will **save an additional INFO lookup** each time a new RedisClient Connection is opened.

## RedisStats

The new 
[RedisStats](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Redis/RedisStats.cs) 
class provides better visibility and introspection into your running instances:

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <td><b>TotalCommandsSent</b></td> <td>Total number of commands sent</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>TotalFailovers</b></td> <td>Number of times the Redis Client Managers have FailoverTo() either by sentinel or manually</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>TotalDeactivatedClients</b></td> <td>Number of times a Client was deactivated from the pool, either by FailoverTo() or exceptions on client</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>TotalFailedSentinelWorkers</b></td> <td>Number of times connecting to a Sentinel has failed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>TotalForcedMasterFailovers</b></td> <td>Number of times we've forced Sentinel to failover to another master due to consecutive errors</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>TotalInvalidMasters</b></td> <td>Number of times a connecting to a reported Master wasn't actually a Master</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>TotalNoMastersFound</b></td> <td>Number of times no Masters could be found in any of the configured hosts</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>TotalClientsCreated</b></td> <td>Number of Redis Client instances created with RedisConfig.ClientFactory</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>TotalClientsCreatedOutsidePool</b></td> <td>Number of times a Redis Client was created outside of pool, either due to overflow or reserved slot was overridden</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>TotalSubjectiveServersDown</b></td> <td>Number of times Redis Sentinel reported a Subjective Down (sdown)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>TotalObjectiveServersDown</b></td> <td>Number of times Redis Sentinel reported an Objective Down (odown)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>TotalRetryCount</b></td> <td>Number of times a Redis Request was retried due to Socket or Retryable exception</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>TotalRetrySuccess</b></td> <td>Number of times a Request succeeded after it was retried</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>TotalRetryTimedout</b></td> <td>Number of times a Retry Request failed after exceeding RetryTimeout</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>TotalPendingDeactivatedClients</b></td> <td>Total number of deactivated clients that are pending being disposed</td>
    </tr>
</table>

You can get and print a dump of all the stats at anytime with:

```csharp
RedisStats.ToDictionary().PrintDump();
```

And Reset all Stats back to `0` with `RedisStats.Reset()`.

### Injectable Resolver Strategy 

To support the different host resolution behavior required for Redis Sentinel, we've decoupled the Redis 
Host Resolution behavior into an injectable strategy which can be overridden by implementing 
[IRedisResolver](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Redis/IRedisResolver.cs)
and injected into any of the Redis Client Managers with:

```csharp
redisManager.RedisResolver = new CustomHostResolver();
```

Whilst this an advanced customization option not expected to be used, it does allow using a custom strategy to 
change which Redis hosts to connect to. See the
[RedisResolverTests](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis/blob/master/tests/ServiceStack.Redis.Tests.Sentinel/RedisResolverTests.cs)
for more info.

### New APIs

  - PopItemsFromSet()
  - DebugSleep()
  - GetServerRole()

The `RedisPubSubServer` is now able to listen to a **pattern** of multiple channels with:

```csharp
var redisPubSub = new RedisPubSubServer(redisManager) {
    ChannelsMatching = new[] { "events.in.*", "events.out." }
};
redisPubSub.Start();
```

### Deprecated APIs

 - The `SetEntry*` API's have been deprecated in favor of the more appropriately named `SetValue*` API's

## OrmLite Converters!

OrmLite has become a lot more customizable and extensible thanks to the internal redesign decoupling all 
custom logic for handling different Field Types into individual Type Converters. 
This redesign makes it possible to enhance or entirely replace how .NET Types are handled. OrmLite can now 
be extended to support new Types it has no knowledge about, a feature taken advantage of by the new support 
for SQL Server's `SqlGeography`, `SqlGeometry` and `SqlHierarchyId` Types!

Despite the scope of this internal refactor, OrmLite's existing test suite (and a number of new tests) continue 
to pass for each supported RDBMS. Whilst the **Firebird** and **VistaDB** providers having been greatly improved 
and now also pass the existing test suite (RowVersion's the only feature not implemented in VistaDB due 
to its lack of triggers).

![OrmLite Converters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/release-notes/ormlite-converters.png)

### Improved encapsulation, reuse, customization and debugging

Converters allows for greater re-use where the common functionality to support each type is maintained in the common
[ServiceStack.OrmLite/Converters](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/tree/master/src/ServiceStack.OrmLite/Converters)
whilst any RDBMS-specific functionality can inherit the common converters and provide any specialization 
required to support that type. E.g. SQL Server specific converters are maintained in 
[ServiceStack.OrmLite.SqlServer/Converters](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/tree/master/src/ServiceStack.OrmLite.SqlServer/Converters)
with each converter inheriting shared functionality and only adding custom logic required to support that 
Type in Sql Server. 

### Creating Converters

They also provide better encapsulation since everything relating to handling the field type is contained within 
a single class definition. A Converter is any class implementing
[IOrmLiteConverter](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.OrmLite/IOrmLiteConverter.cs)
although it's instead recommended to inherit from the `OrmLiteConverter` abstract class which allows
only the minimum API's needing to be overridden, namely the `ColumnDefinition` 
used when creating the Table definition and the ADO.NET `DbType` it should use in parameterized queries. 
An example of this is in 
[GuidConverter](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.OrmLite/Converters/GuidConverter.cs):

```csharp
public class GuidConverter : OrmLiteConverter
{
    public override string ColumnDefinition
    {
        get { return "GUID"; }
    }

    public override DbType DbType
    {
        get { return DbType.Guid; }
    }
}
```

But for this to work in SQL Server the `ColumnDefinition` should instead be **UniqueIdentifier** which is also
what it needs to be cast to, to be able to query Guid's in an SQL Statement. 
Therefore it requires a custom 
[SqlServerGuidConverter](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.OrmLite.SqlServer/Converters/SqlServerGuidConverter.cs)
to support Guids in SQL Server:

```csharp
public class SqlServerGuidConverter : GuidConverter
{
    public override string ColumnDefinition
    {
        get { return "UniqueIdentifier"; }
    }

    public override string ToQuotedString(Type fieldType, object value)
    {
        var guidValue = (Guid)value;
        return string.Format("CAST('{0}' AS UNIQUEIDENTIFIER)", guidValue);
    }
}
```

### Registering Converters

To get OrmLite to use this new Custom Converter for SQL Server, the `SqlServerOrmLiteDialectProvider` just
[registers it in its constructor](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/blob/41226795fc12f1b65d6af70c177a5ff57fa70334/src/ServiceStack.OrmLite.SqlServer/SqlServerOrmLiteDialectProvider.cs#L41):

```csharp
base.RegisterConverter<Guid>(new SqlServerGuidConverter());
```

Overriding the pre-registered `GuidConverter` to enable its extended functionality in SQL Server.

You'll also use the `RegisterConverter<T>()` API to register your own Custom GuidCoverter on the RDBMS 
provider you want it to apply to, e.g for SQL Server:

```csharp
SqlServerDialect.Provider.RegisterConverter<Guid>(new MyCustomGuidConverter());
```

### Resolving Converters

If needed, it can be later retrieved with:

```csharp
IOrmLiteConverter converter = SqlServerDialect.Provider.GetConverter<Guid>();
var myGuidConverter = (MyCustomGuidConverter)converter;
```

### Debugging Converters

Custom Converters can also enable a better debugging story where if you want to see what value gets retrieved 
from the database, you can override and add a breakpoint on the base method letting you inspect the value 
returned from the ADO.NET Data Reader:

```csharp
public class MyCustomGuidConverter : SqlServerGuidConverter
{
    public overridde object FromDbValue(Type fieldType, object value)
    {
        return base.FromDbValue(fieldType, value); //add breakpoint
    }
}
```

### Enhancing an existing Converter

An example of when you'd want to do this is if you wanted to use the `Guid` property in your POCO's on 
legacy tables which stored Guids in `VARCHAR` columns, in which case you can also add support for converting 
the returned strings back into Guid's with:

```csharp
public class MyCustomGuidConverter : SqlServerGuidConverter
{
    public overridde object FromDbValue(Type fieldType, object value)
    {
        var strValue = value as string; 
        return strValue != null
            ? new Guid(strValue);
            : base.FromDbValue(fieldType, value); 
    }
}
```

### Override handling of existing Types

Another popular Use Case now enabled with Converters is being able to override built-in functionality based
on preference. E.g. By default TimeSpans are stored in the database as Ticks in a `BIGINT` column since it's  
the most reliable way to retain the same TimeSpan value uniformly across all RDBMS's. 

E.g SQL Server's **TIME** data type can't store Times greater than 24 hours or with less precision than **3ms**. 
But if using a **TIME** column was preferred it can now be enabled by registering to use the new
[SqlServerTimeConverter](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.OrmLite.SqlServer/Converters/SqlServerTimeConverter.cs) 
instead:

```csharp
SqlServerDialect.Provider.RegisterConverter<TimeSpan>(new SqlServerTimeConverter { 
   Precision = 7 
});
```

### Customizable Field Definitions

Another benefit is they allow for easy customization as seen with `Precision` property which will now 
create tables using the `TIME(7)` Column definition for TimeSpan properties.

For RDBMS's that don't have a native `Guid` type like Oracle or Firebird, you had an option to choose whether
you wanted to save them as text for better readability (default) or in a more efficient compact binary format. 
Previously this preference was maintained in a boolean flag along with multiple Guid implementations hard-coded 
at different entry points within each DialectProvider. This complexity has now been removed, now to store guids 
in a compact binary format you'll instead register the preferred Converter implementation, e.g:

```csharp
FirebirdDialect.Provider.RegisterConverter<Guid>(
    new FirebirdCompactGuidConverter());
```

### Changing String Column Behavior

This is another area improved with Converters where previously any available field customizations required 
maintaining state inside each provider. Now any customizations are encapsulated within each Converter and 
can be modified directly on its concrete Type without unnecessarily polluting the surface area of the primary 
[IOrmLiteDialectProvider](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.OrmLite/IOrmLiteDialectProvider.cs)
which used to create new API's every time a new customization option was added.

Now to customize the behavior of how strings are stored you can change them directly on the `StringConverter`, e.g:

```csharp
StringConverter converter = OrmLiteConfig.DialectProvider.GetStringConverter();
converter.UseUnicode = true;
converter.StringLength = 100;
```

Which will change the default column definitions for strings to use `NVARCHAR(100)` for RDBMS's that support
Unicode or `VARCHAR(100)` for those that don't. 

The `GetStringConverter()` API is just an extension method wrapping the generic `GetConverter()` API to return
a concrete type:

```csharp
public static StringConverter GetStringConverter(this IOrmLiteDialectProvider dialect)
{
    return (StringConverter)dialect.GetConverter(typeof(string));
}
```

Typed extension methods are also provided for other popular types offering additional customizations including
`GetDecimalConverter()` and `GetDateTimeConverter()`.

### Specify the DateKind in DateTimes

It's now much simpler and requires less effort to implement new features that maintain the same behavior 
across all supported RDBM's thanks to better cohesion, re-use and reduced internal state. One new feature
we've added as a result is the new `DateStyle` customization on `DateTimeConverter` which lets you change how 
Date's are persisted and populated, e.g: 

```csharp
DateTimeConverter converter = OrmLiteConfig.DialectProvider.GetDateTimeConverter();
converter.DateStyle = DateTimeKind.Local;
```

Will save `DateTime` in the database and populate them back on data models as LocalTime. 
This is also available for Utc:

```csharp
converter.DateStyle = DateTimeKind.Utc;
```

Default is `Unspecified` which doesn't do any conversions and just uses the DateTime returned by the ADO.NET provider.
Examples of the behavior of the different DateStyle's is available in
[DateTimeTests](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/blob/master/tests/ServiceStack.OrmLite.Tests/DateTimeTests.cs).

### SQL Server Special Type Converters!

Just as the ground work for Converters were laid down, [@KevinHoward](https://github.com/KevinHoward) from the
ServiceStack Community noticed OrmLite could now be extended to support new Types and promptly contributed
Converters for SQL Server-specific 
[SqlGeography](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.OrmLite.SqlServer.Converters/SqlServerGeographyTypeConverter.cs), 
[SqlGeometry](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.OrmLite.SqlServer.Converters/SqlServerGeometryTypeConverter.cs) 
and 
[SqlHierarchyId](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.OrmLite.SqlServer.Converters/SqlServerHierarchyIdTypeConverter.cs) 
Types!

Since these Types require an external dependency to the **Microsoft.SqlServer.Types** NuGet package they're
contained in a separate NuGet package that can be installed with:

    PM> Install-Package ServiceStack.OrmLite.SqlServer.Converters

Alternative Strong-named version:

    PM> Install-Package ServiceStack.OrmLite.SqlServer.Converters.Signed

Once installed, all available SQL Server Types can be registered on your SQL Server Provider with:

```csharp
SqlServerConverters.Configure(SqlServer2012Dialect.Provider);
```

#### Example Usage

After the Converters are registered they can treated like a normal .NET Type, e.g:

**SqlHierarchyId** Example:

```csharp
public class Node {
    [AutoIncrement]
    public long Id { get; set; }
    public SqlHierarchyId TreeId { get; set; }
}

db.DropAndCreateTable<Node>();

var treeId = SqlHierarchyId.Parse("/1/1/3/"); // 0x5ADE is hex
db.Insert(new Node { TreeId = treeId });

var parent = db.Scalar<SqlHierarchyId>(db.From<Node>().Select("TreeId.GetAncestor(1)"));
parent.ToString().Print(); //= /1/1/
```

**SqlGeography** and **SqlGeometry** Example:

```csharp
public class GeoTest {
    public long Id { get; set; }
    public SqlGeography Location { get; set; }
    public SqlGeometry Shape { get; set; }
}

db.DropAndCreateTable<GeoTest>();

var geo = SqlGeography.Point(40.6898329,-74.0452177, 4326); // Statue of Liberty

// A simple line from (0,0) to (4,4)  Length = SQRT(2 * 4^2)
var wkt = new System.Data.SqlTypes.SqlChars("LINESTRING(0 0, 4 4)".ToCharArray());
var shape = SqlGeometry.STLineFromText(wkt, 0);

db.Insert(new GeoTestTable { Id = 1, Location = geo, Shape = shape });
var dbShape = db.SingleById<GeoTest>(1).Shape;

new { dbShape.STEndPoint().STX, dbShape.STEndPoint().STY }.PrintDump();
```

Output:

    {
        STX: 4,
        STY: 4
    }
    
### New SQL Server 2012 Dialect Provider

There's a new `SqlServer2012Dialect.Provider` to take advantage of optimizations available in recent versions 
of SQL Server, that's now recommended for use with SQL Server 2012 and later.

```csharp
container.Register<IDbConnectionFactory>(c => 
    new OrmLiteConnectionFactory(connString, SqlServer2012Dialect.Provider);
```

The new `SqlServer2012Dialect` takes advantage of SQL Server's new **OFFSET** and **FETCH** support to enable more 
[optimal paged queries](http://dbadiaries.com/new-t-sql-features-in-sql-server-2012-offset-and-fetch) 
that replaces the 
[Windowing Function hack](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2135449/85785) 
required to support earlier versions of SQL Server.

### Nested Typed Sub SqlExpressions

The `Sql.In()` API has been expanded by [Johann Klemmack](https://github.com/jklemmack) to support nesting
and combining of multiple Typed SQL Expressions together in a single SQL Query, e.g:
  
```csharp
var usaCustomerIds = db.From<Customer>(c => c.Country == "USA").Select(c => c.Id);
var usaCustomerOrders = db.Select(db.From<Order>()
    .Where(q => Sql.In(q.CustomerId, usaCustomerIds)));
```
 
### Descending Indexes

Descending composite Indexes can be declared with:
 
 ```csharp
[CompositeIndex("Field1", "Field2 DESC")]
public class Poco { ... }
```

### Dapper Updated

The embedded version of Dapper in the `ServiceStack.OrmLite.Dapper` namespace has been upgraded to the 
latest version of Dapper and also includes Dapper's Async API's in .NET 4.5 builds.

#### CSV Support for dynamic Dapper results

The CSV Serializer also added support for Dapper's dynamic results:

```csharp
IEnumerable<dynamic> results = db.Query("select * from Poco");
string csv = CsvSerializer.SerializeToCsv(results);
```

#### OrmLite CSV Example

OrmLite avoids `dynamic` and instead prefers the use of code-first POCO's, where the above example translates to:

```csharp
var results = db.Select<Poco>();
var csv = results.ToCsv();
```

To query untyped results in OrmLite when no POCO's exist, you can read them into a generic Dictionary:

```csharp 
var results = db.Select<Dictionary<string,object>>("select * from Poco");
var csv = results.ToCsv();
```

### Order By Random

The new `OrderByRandom()` API abstracts the differences in each RDBMS to return rows in a random order:

```csharp 
var randomRows = db.Select<Poco>(q => q.OrderByRandom());
```

### Other OrmLite Features

`CreateTableIfNotExists` returns `true` if a new table was created which is convenient for only populating
non-existing tables with new data on your Application StartUp, e.g:
 
 ```csharp
if (db.CreateTableIfNotExists<Poco>()) {
    AddSeedData(db);
}
 ```

 - OrmLite Debug Logging includes DB Param names and values  
 - Char fields now use CHAR(1)
  
## [Encrypted Messaging](/encrypted-messaging)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/release-notes/encrypted-messaging.png)

### Encrypted Messages verified with HMAC SHA-256

The authenticity of Encrypted Messages are now being verified with HMAC SHA-256, essentially following an 
[Encrypt-then-MAC strategy](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/205/25652). The change to the existing process
is that a new AES 256 **Auth Key** is used to Authenticate the encrypted data which is then sent along
with the **Crypt Key**, encrypted with the Server's Public Key. 

An updated version of this process is now:

  1. Client creates a new `IEncryptedClient` configured with the Server **Public Key**
  2. Client uses the `IEncryptedClient` to create a EncryptedMessage Request DTO:
    1. Generates a new AES 256bit/CBC/PKCS7 Crypt Key **(Kc)**, Auth Key **(Ka)** and **IV**
    2. Encrypts Crypt Key **(Kc)**, Auth Key **(Ka)** with Servers Public Key padded with OAEP = **(Kc+Ka+P)e**
    3. Authenticates **(Kc+Ka+P)e** with **IV** using HMAC SHA-256 = **IV+(Kc+Ka+P)e+Tag**
    4. Serializes Request DTO to JSON packed with current `Timestamp`, `Verb` and `Operation` = **(M)**
    5. Encrypts **(M)** with Crypt Key **(Kc)** and **IV** = **(M)e**
    6. Authenticates **(M)e** with Auth Key **(Ka)** and **IV** = **IV+(M)e+Tag**
    7. Creates `EncryptedMessage` DTO with Servers `KeyId`, **IV+(Kc+Ka+P)e+Tag** and **IV+(M)e+Tag**
  3. Client uses the `IEncryptedClient` to send the populated `EncryptedMessage` to the remote Server

On the Server, the `EncryptedMessagingFeature` Request Converter processes the `EncryptedMessage` DTO:

  1. Uses Private Key identified by **KeyId** or the current Private Key if **KeyId** wasn't provided
    1. Request Converter Extracts **IV+(Kc+Ka+P)e+Tag** into **IV** and **(Kc+Ka+P)e+Tag**
    2. Decrypts **(Kc+Ka+P)e+Tag** with Private Key into **(Kc)** and **(Ka)**
    3. The **IV** is checked against the nonce Cache, verified it's never been used before, then cached
    4. The **IV+(Kc+Ka+P)e+Tag** is verified it hasn't been tampered with using Auth Key **(Ka)**
    5. The **IV+(M)e+Tag** is verified it hasn't been tampered with using Auth Key **(Ka)**
    6. The **IV+(M)e+Tag** is decrypted using Crypt Key **(Kc)** = **(M)**
    7. The **timestamp** is verified it's not older than `EncryptedMessagingFeature.MaxRequestAge`
    8. Any expired nonces are removed. (The **timestamp** and **IV** are used to prevent replay attacks)
    9. The JSON body is deserialized and resulting **Request DTO** returned from the Request Converter
  2. The converted **Request DTO** is executed in ServiceStack's Request Pipeline as normal
  3. The **Response DTO** is picked up by the EncryptedMessagingFeature **Response Converter**:
    1. Any **Cookies** set during the Request are removed
    2. The **Response DTO** is serialized with the **AES Key** and returned in an `EncryptedMessageResponse`
  4. The `IEncryptedClient` decrypts the `EncryptedMessageResponse` with the **AES Key**
    1. The **Response DTO** is extracted and returned to the caller

### Support for versioning Private Keys with Key Rotations

Another artifact introduced in the above process was the mention of a new `KeyId`. 
This is a human readable string used to identify the Servers Public Key using the first 7 characters
of the Public Key Modulus (visible when viewing the Private Key serialized as XML). 
This is automatically sent by `IEncryptedClient` to tell the `EncryptedMessagingFeature` which Private Key 
should be used to decrypt the AES Crypt and Auth Keys.

By supporting multiple private keys, the Encrypted Messaging feature allows the seamless transition to a 
new Private Key without affecting existing clients who have yet to adopt the latest Public Key. 

Transitioning to a new Private Key just involves taking the existing Private Key and adding it to the 
`FallbackPrivateKeys` collection whilst introducing a new Private Key, e.g:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new EncryptedMessagesFeature
{
    PrivateKey = NewPrivateKey,
    FallbackPrivateKeys = {
        PreviousKey2015,
        PreviousKey2014,
    },
});
```

### Why Rotate Private Keys?

Since anyone who has a copy of the Private Key can decrypt encrypted messages, rotating the private key clients
use limits the amount of exposure an adversary who has managed to get a hold of a compromised private key has. 
i.e. if the current Private Key was somehow compromised, an attacker with access to the encrypted 
network packets will be able to read each message sent that was encrypted with the compromised private key 
up until the Server introduces a new Private Key which clients switches over to.

## [Swagger UI](/swagger-api)

The Swagger Metadata backend has been upgraded to support the 
[Swagger 1.2 Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md)

### Basic Auth added to Swagger UI

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/release-notes/swagger-basicauth.png)

Users can call protected Services using the Username and Password fields in Swagger UI. 
Swagger sends these credentials with every API request using HTTP Basic Auth, 
which can be enabled in your AppHost with:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(...,
      new IAuthProvider[] { 
        new BasicAuthProvider(), //Allow Sign-ins with HTTP Basic Auth
      }));
```

Alternatively users can login outside of Swagger, to access protected Services in Swagger UI.
  
## Auth Info displayed in [Metadata Pages](/metadata-page)

Metadata pages now label protected Services. On the metadata index page it displays a yellow key next to
each Service requiring Authentication:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/release-notes/metadata-auth-summary.png)

Hovering over the key will show which also permissions or roles the Service needs.

This information is also shown the metadata detail pages which will list which permissions/roles are required (if any), e.g:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/release-notes/metadata-auth.png)

## [Java Native Types](/java-add-servicestack-reference)

### [Java Functional Utils](https://github.com/mythz/java-linq-examples)

The Core Java Functional Utils required to run 
[C#'s 101 LINQ Samples in Java](https://github.com/mythz/java-linq-examples) 
have been added to the **net.servicestack:client** Java package which as its compatible with Java 1.7, 
also runs on Android:

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/wikis/java/linq-examples-screenshot.png)](https://github.com/mythz/java-linq-examples)

Whilst noticeably more verbose than most languages, it enables a functional style of programming that provides
an alternative to imperative programming with mutating collections and eases porting efforts of functional code 
which can be mapped to its equivalent core functional method.

### New TreatTypesAsStrings option

Due to the [unusual encoding of Guid bytes](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18085116/85785) it may be instead be 
preferential to treat Guids as opaque strings so they are easier to compare back to their original C# Guids. 
This can be enabled with the new `TreatTypesAsStrings` option:

```
/* Options:
...
TreatTypesAsStrings: Guid

*/
```

Which will emit `String` data types for `Guid` properties that are deserialized back into .NET Guid's as strings.

## [Swift Native Types](/swift-add-servicestack-reference)

All Swift reserved keywords are now escaped, allowing them to be used in DTO's.

## [Service Clients](/csharp-client)

All .NET Service Clients (inc [JsonHttpClient](/csharp-client#jsonhttpclient))
can now be used to send raw `string`, `byte[]` or `Stream` Request bodies in their custom Sync or Async API's, e.g:
 
```csharp
string json = "{\"Key\":1}";
client.Post<SendRawResponse>("/sendraw", json);

byte[] bytes = json.ToUtf8Bytes();
client.Put<SendRawResponse>("/sendraw", bytes);

Stream stream = new MemoryStream(bytes);
await client.PostAsync<SendRawResponse>("/sendraw", stream);
```
 
## Authentication

### [Community Azure Active Directory Auth Provider](https://github.com/jfoshee/ServiceStack.Authentication.Aad)

[Jacob Foshee](https://github.com/jfoshee) from the ServiceStack Community has published a 
[ServiceStack AuthProvider for Azure Active Directory](https://github.com/jfoshee/ServiceStack.Authentication.Aad).

To get started, Install it from NuGet with:

    PM> Install-Package ServiceStack.Authentication.Aad

Then add the `AadAuthProvider` AuthProvider to your `AuthFeature` registration:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(..., 
    new IAuthProvider[] { 
        new AadAuthProvider(AppSettings) 
    });
```

See the docs on the 
[Projects Homepage](https://github.com/jfoshee/ServiceStack.Authentication.Aad)
for instructions on how to Configure the Azure Directory OAuth Provider in your applications `<appSettings/>`.

### MaxLoginAttempts

The `MaxLoginAttempts` feature has been moved out from `OrmLiteAuthRepository` into a global option in the 
`AuthFeature` plugin where this feature has now been added to all User Auth Repositories. 

E.g. you can lock a User Account after 5 invalid login attempts with:
 
```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(...) {
    MaxLoginAttempts = 5
});
```
 
### Generate New Session Cookies on Authentication 

Previously the Authentication provider only removed Users Cookies after they explicitly log out. 
The AuthFeature now also regenerates new Session Cookies each time users login. 
If you were previously relying on the user maintaining the same cookies 
(i.e. tracking anonymous user activity) this behavior can be disabled with:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(...) {
    GenerateNewSessionCookiesOnAuthentication = false
});
```

### ClientId and ClientSecret OAuth Config Aliases
 
OAuth Providers can now use `ClientId` and `ClientSecret` aliases instead of `ConsumerKey` and `ConsumerSecret`, e.g:

```xml 
<appSettings>
    <add key="oauth.twitter.ClientId" value="..." />
    <add key="oauth.twitter.ClientSecret" value="..." />
</appSettings>
```

## [Error Handling](/error-handling)

### Custom Response Error Codes

In addition to customizing the HTTP Response Body of C# Exceptions with 
[IResponseStatusConvertible](/error-handling#implementing-iresponsestatusconvertible),
you can also customize the HTTP Status Code by implementing `IHasStatusCode`:

```csharp
public class Custom401Exception : Exception, IHasStatusCode
{
    public int StatusCode 
    { 
        get { return 401; } 
    }
}
```

Which is a more cohesive alternative that registering the equivalent 
[StatusCode Mapping](/error-handling#custom-mapping-of-c-exceptions-to-http-error-status):

```csharp
SetConfig(new HostConfig { 
    MapExceptionToStatusCode = {
        { typeof(Custom401Exception), 401 },
    }
});
```

### Meta Dictionary on ResponseStatus and ResponseError

The [IMeta](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Interfaces/IMeta.cs)
Dictionary has been added to `ResponseStatus` and `ResponseError` DTO's which provides a placeholder to 
be able to send additional context with errors. 

This Meta dictionary will be automatically populated for any `CustomState` on FluentValidation `ValidationFailure` 
that's populated with a `Dictionary<string, string>`.

## [Server Events](/server-events)

The new `ServerEventsFeature.HouseKeepingInterval` option controls the minimum interval for how often SSE 
connections should be routinely scanned and expired subscriptions removed. The default is every 5 seconds.

> As there's no background Thread managing SSE connections, the cleanup happens in periodic SSE heartbeat handlers

Update: An [issue with this feature](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Issues/issues/345) has been resolved 
in the [v4.0.45 pre-release NuGet packages on MyGet](/myget).

## ServiceStack.Text

There are new convenient extension methods for Converting any POCO to and from Object Dictionary, e.g:

```csharp
var dto = new User
{
    FirstName = "First",
    LastName = "Last",
    Car = new Car { Age = 10, Name = "ZCar" },
};

Dictionary<string,object> map = dtoUser.ToObjectDictionary();

User user = (User)map.FromObjectDictionary(typeof(User));
```

Like most Reflection API's in ServiceStack this is fairly efficient as it uses cached compiled delegates.

There's also an extension method for adding types to `List<Type>`, e.g:

```csharp
var types = new List<Type>()
    .Add<User>()
    .Add<Car>();
```

Which is a cleaner equivalent to:

```csharp
var types = new List<Type>();
types.Add(typeof(User));
types.Add(typeof(User));
```
