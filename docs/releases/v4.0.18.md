## New, much faster Self-Host!

Prior to this release ServiceStack had 2 self-hosting options with different [Concurrency Models](/concurrency-model):

- `AppHostHttpListenerBase` - Executes requests on the IO callback thread
- `AppHostHttpListenerPoolBase` - Executes requests on .NET's built-in ThreadPool

Where in typical scenarios (i.e. CPU intensive or blocking IO), executing on .NET's Thread Pool provides better performance.

This [Self-hosting performance analysis](http://en.rdebug.com/2013/05/06/servicestack-selfhosted-performance-boost/) from the ServiceStack community shows we're able to achieve even better performance by utilizing the excellent [Smart Thread Pool](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/7933/Smart-Thread-Pool) instead, which is now available in the `AppHostHttpListenerSmartPoolBase` base class.

The new Smart Pool self-host routinely outperforms all other self hosting options, and does especially well in heavy IO scenarios as seen in the benchmarks below: 

<table>

        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Self Host</th>

    <tbody>
        <tr>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Using different Self Host options

You can easily switch between the different self-hosting options by simply changing your AppHost's base class, e.g: 

```csharp
public class AppHost : AppHostHttpListenerBase { ... }
public class AppHost : AppHostHttpListenerPoolBase { ... }
public class AppHost : AppHostHttpListenerSmartPoolBase { ... }
```

Both the HttpListener Pool and SmartPool hosts have configurable pool sizes that can be tweaked to perform better under different scenarios.

### Optimal Self Hosted option

As the number of self-hosts grow, we've added a new `AppSelfHostBase` base class that represents an alias for the highest performing self-hosting option with an optimal configuration that we'll continue to tune for performance against typical scenarios. Unless you've identified specific configurations that performs better for your use-case, the recommendation is for new self-hosts to inherit this configuration:

```csharp
public class AppHost : AppSelfHostBase { ... }
```

## OrmLite 

OrmLite received a lot more attention this release with a number of value-added additions:

### Improved Oracle RDBMS provider

The OrmLite Oracle Provider has been significantly improved thanks to [Bruce Cowen](https://github.com/BruceCowan-AI) efforts who's brought the quality in-line with other RDBMS providers which now passes OrmLite's test suite. As part of this change, the Oracle Provider now depends on [Oracle's Data Provider for .NET](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/index-085163.html) and can be installed with: 

    PM> Install-Package ServiceStack.OrmLite.Oracle
    PM> Install-Package ServiceStack.OrmLite.Oracle.Signed

More notes about the Oracle provider are maintained in the [OrmLite Release Notes](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/#oracle-provider-notes).

### Improved Typed SqlExpressions

The existing `db.SqlExpression<T>()` API has a more readable alias in:

```csharp
db.From<Table>();
```

Which now supports an optional SQL **FROM** fragment that can be used to specify table joins, e.g:

    var results = db.Select(db.From<Person>("Person INNER JOIN Band ON Person.Id = Band.PersonId"));

#### New ISqlExpression API

OrmLite API's have overloads to execute any SQL builders that implement the simple `ISqlExpression` API, i.e:

```csharp
public interface ISqlExpression
{
    string ToSelectStatement();
}
```

This allows for more readable code when using a decoupled Sql Builder, e.g:

```csharp
int over40s = db.Scalar<int>(db.From<Person>().Select(Sql.Count("*")).Where(q => q.Age > 40));

List<string> lastNames = db.Column<string>(db.From<Person>().Select(x => x.LastName).Where(q => q.Age == 27));

HashSet<int> uniqueAges = db.ColumnDistinct<int>(db.From<Person>().Select(x => x.Age).Where(q => q.Age < 50));

Dictionary<int,string> map = db.Dictionary<int,string>(db.From<Person>().Select(x => new {x.Id, x.LastName}));
```

#### Partial Selects

This also improves the APIs for partial SELECT queries, which originally required the use of custom SQL:

```csharp
var partialColumns = db.SelectFmt<SubsetOfShipper>(typeof(Shipper), "ShipperTypeId = {0}", 2);
```
    
But can now be expressed in any of the more typed examples below: 

```csharp
var partialColumns = db.Select<SubsetOfShipper>(db.From<Shipper>().Where(q => q.ShipperTypeId == 2));
```

Or partially populating the same POCO with only the columns specified:

```csharp
var partialColumns = db.Select<Shipper>(q => q.Select(x => new { x.Phone, x.CompanyName })
                                              .Where(x => x.ShipperTypeId == 2));

var partialColumns = db.Select<Shipper>(q => q.Select("Phone, CompanyName")
                                              .Where(x => x.ShipperTypeId == 2));
```

#### Nullable Limit APIs

The Limit API's now accept `int?` making it easier to apply paging in your ServiceStack services, e.g:

```csharp
public Request 
{
    public int? Skip { get; set; }
    public int? Take { get; set; }
}

public List<Table> Any(Request request)
{
    return Db.Select(db.From<Table>.Limit(request.Skip, request.Take));
}
```

Which will only filter the results for the values provided. Aliases for `Skip()` and `Take()` are also available if LINQ naming is preferred.

#### New AliasNamingStrategy

A new alias naming strategy was added (in addition to `[Alias]` attribute) that lets you specify a dictionary of Table and Column aliases OrmLite should used instead, e.g:

```csharp
OrmLiteConfig.DialectProvider.NamingStrategy = new AliasNamingStrategy {
    TableAliases  = { { "MyTable", "TableAlias" } },
    ColumnAliases = { { "MyField", "ColumnAlias" } },
};
```

Which OrmLite will use instead, e.g when creating a table:

```csharp
db.CreateTable<MyTable>();
```

Aliases can also be referenced when creating custom SQL using the `SqlTable()` and `SqlColumn()` extension methods, e.g:

```csharp
var result = db.SqlList<MyTable>(
    "SELECT * FROM {0} WHERE {1} = {2}".Fmt("MyTable".SqlTable(), "MyField".SqlColumn(), "foo".SqlValue()));
```

#### New Exists APIs

Nicer if you just need to check for existence, instead of retrieving a full result-set e.g:

```csharp
bool hasUnder50s = db.Exists<Person>(x => x.Age < 50);
bool hasUnder50s = db.Exists(db.From<Person>().Where(x => x.Age < 50));
```

## Redis

### New Scan APIs Added

Redis v2.8 introduced a beautiful new [SCAN](http://redis.io/commands/scan) operation that provides an optimal strategy for traversing a redis instance entire keyset in managable-size chunks utilizing only a client-side cursor and without introducing any server state. It's a higher performance alternative and should be used instead of [KEYS](http://redis.io/commands/keys) in application code. SCAN and its related operations for traversing members of Sets, Sorted Sets and Hashes are now available in the Redis Client in the following API's:

```csharp
public interface IRedisClient
{
    ...
    IEnumerable<string> ScanAllKeys(string pattern = null, int pageSize = 1000);
    IEnumerable<string> ScanAllSetItems(string setId, string pattern = null, int pageSize = 1000);
    IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, double>> ScanAllSortedSetItems(string setId, string pattern = null, int pageSize = 1000);
    IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, string>> ScanAllHashEntries(string hashId, string pattern = null, int pageSize = 1000);    
}

//Low-level API
public interface IRedisNativeClient
{
    ...
    ScanResult Scan(ulong cursor, int count = 10, string match = null);
    ScanResult SScan(string setId, ulong cursor, int count = 10, string match = null);
    ScanResult ZScan(string setId, ulong cursor, int count = 10, string match = null);
    ScanResult HScan(string hashId, ulong cursor, int count = 10, string match = null);
}
```

The `IRedisClient` provides a higher-level API that abstracts away the client cursor to expose a lazy Enumerable sequence to provide an optimal way to stream scanned results that integrates nicely with LINQ, e.g:

```csharp
var scanUsers = Redis.ScanAllKeys("urn:User:*");
var sampleUsers = scanUsers.Take(10000).ToList(); //Stop after retrieving 10000 user keys 
```

### New HyperLog API

The development branch of Redis server (available when v3.0 is released) includes an ingenious algorithm to approximate the unique elements in a set with maximum space and time efficiency. For details about how it works see Redis's creator Salvatore's blog who [explains it in great detail](http://antirez.com/news/75). Essentially it lets you maintain an efficient way to count and merge unique elements in a set without having to store its elements. 
A Simple example of it in action:

```csharp
redis.AddToHyperLog("set1", "a", "b", "c");
redis.AddToHyperLog("set1", "c", "d");
var count = redis.CountHyperLog("set1"); //4

redis.AddToHyperLog("set2", "c", "d", "e", "f");

redis.MergeHyperLogs("mergedset", "set1", "set2");

var mergeCount = redis.CountHyperLog("mergedset"); //6
```

## HTTP and MQ Service Clients

### Substitutable OneWay MQ and HTTP Service Clients

Service Clients and MQ Clients have become a lot more interoperable where all MQ Clients now implement the Service Clients `IOneWayClient` API which enables writing code that works with both HTTP and MQ Clients:

```csharp
IOneWayClient client = GetClient();
client.SendOneWay(new RequestDto { ... });
```

Likewise the HTTP Service Clients implement the Messaging API `IMessageProducer`:

```csharp
void Publish<T>(T requestDto);
void Publish<T>(IMessage<T> message);
```

When publishing a `IMessage<T>` the message metadata are sent as HTTP Headers with an `X-` prefix.

### UploadProgress added on Service Clients

Which works similar to [OnDownloadProgress](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/tests/ServiceStack.WebHost.Endpoints.Tests/AsyncProgressTests.cs) where you can specify a callback to provide UX Progress updates, e.g:

```csharp
client.OnUploadProgress = (bytesWritten, total) => "Written {0}/{1} bytes...".Print(bytesWritten, total);

client.PostFileWithRequest<UploadResponse>(url, new FileInfo(path), new Upload { CreatedBy = "Me" });
```

## Razor Support

Our support for [No Ceremony Razor pages](https://github.com/ServiceStack/EmailContacts/#the-no-ceremony-option---dynamic-pages-without-controllers) has been very well received which has all but alleviated the need of requiring services / controllers for dynamic html pages. One of the areas where a Service may be required is for execution any custom request filters, which we've now added support for by letting you choose to execute all request filters for a specific Request with: 

```csharp
@{
    ApplyRequestFilters(new RequestDto());
}
```

This will execute all the Request Filters applied to the specified Request DTO. Any one of the filters ends the request (e.g. with a redirect) and the rest of the Razor page will stop execution.

Likewise it's possible to redirect from within Razor with:

```csharp
@{
    if (!IsAuthenticated) {
        Response.RedirectToUrl("/login");
        throw new StopExecutionException();
    }
}
```
An alternative to `StopExecutionException` is to have an explicit `return;`, the difference being that it will continue to execute the remainder of the page, although neither approach will emit any Razor output to the response.

As redirecting non-authenticated users is a common use-case it's also available as a one-liner:

```csharp
@{
    RedirectIfNotAuthenticated();
}
```

Which if no url is specified it will redirect to the path configured on `AuthFeature.HtmlRedirect`.

### ss-utils.js

A few enhancements were added to ServiceStack's **/js/ss-utils.js** is ServiceStack's built-in JS library, first demonstrated in [Email Contacts solution](https://github.com/ServiceStack/EmailContacts/#servicestack-javascript-utils---jsss-utilsjs):

Declarative event handlers can send multiple arguments:

```html
<ul>
    <li data-click="single">Foo</li>
    <li data-click="multiple:arg1,arg2">Bar</li>
</ul>
```

```javascript
$(document).bindHandlers({
    single: function(){
        var li = this;
    },
    multiple: function(arg1, arg2) {
        var li = this;
    }
});
```

Trigger client-side validation errors with `setFieldError()`:

```javascript
$("form").bindForm({
    validate: function(){
        var params = $(this).serializeMap();
        if (params.Password != params.Confirm){
            $(this).setFieldError('Password', 'Passwords to not match');
            return false;
        }
    }
});
```

Model binding now also populates `data-href` and `data-src` attributes e.g:

```html
<a data-href="FieldName"><img data-src="FieldName" /></a>
```

```javascript
$("form").applyValues({ FieldName: imgUrl });
```
## Other Changes

### Restriction attributes allowed on Services
    
Restriction attributes can be added on Service classes in addition to Request DTOs (which still take precedence).

```csharp
[Restrict(LocalhostOnly = true)]
public class LocalHostOnlyServices : Service { ... }
```

## AppSettings

### New OrmLiteAppSettings

Added new read/write AppSettings config option utilizing OrmLite as the back-end. 
This now lets you maintain your applications configuration in any [RDBMS back-end OrmLite supports](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/#download). It basically works like a mini Key/Value database in which can store any serializable value against any key which is maintained into the simple Id/Value `ConfigSettings` table.

#### Usage

Registration just uses an OrmLite DB Factory, e.g:

```csharp
container.Register(c => new OrmLiteAppSettings(c.Resolve<IDbConnectionFactory>()));
var appSettings = container.Resolve<OrmLiteAppSettings>();
appSettings.InitSchema(); //Create the ConfigSettings table if it doesn't exist
```

It then can be accessed like any [AppSetting APIs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/tests/ServiceStack.Common.Tests/Configuration/AppSettingsTests.cs):

```csharp
//Read the `MyConfig` POCO stored at `config` otherwise use default value if it doesn't exist
MyConfig config = appSettings.Get("config", new MyConfig { Key = "DefaultValue" });
```

It also supports writing config values in addition to the AppSettings read-only API's, e.g:

```csharp
var latestStats = appSettings.GetOrCreate("stats", () => statsProvider.GetLatest());
```

### Extract key / value settings from text file

The new ParseKeyValueText extension method lets you extract key / value data from text, e.g: 

```csharp
var configText = @"
StringKey string value
IntKey 42
ListKey A,B,C,D,E
DictionaryKey A:1,B:2,C:3,D:4,E:5
PocoKey {Foo:Bar,Key:Value}";

Dictionary<string, string> configMap = configText.ParseKeyValueText(delimiter:" ");
```

When combined with the existing `DictionarySettings`, enables a rich, simple and clean alternative to .NET's App.config config section for reading structured configuration into clean data structures, e.g:

```csharp
IAppSettings appSettings = new DictionarySettings(configMap);

string value = appSettings.Get("StringKey");

int value = appSettings.Get("IntKey", defaultValue:1);

List<string> values = appSettings.GetList("ListKey");

Dictionary<string,string> valuesMap = appSettings.GetList("DictionaryKey");

MyConfig config = appSettings.Get("PocoKey", new MyConfig { Key = "DefaultValue"});
```

As we expect this to be a popular combination we've combined them into a single class that accepts a filePath, providing a simple alternative to custom Web.config configurations:

```csharp
var appSettings = new TextFileSettings("~/app.settings".MapHostAbsolutePath());
```

### PerfUtils

We've included the [C# Benchmark Utils](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Common/PerfUtils.cs) previously used in [Sudoku Benchmarks](https://github.com/dartist/sudoku_solver#benchmarks) originally inspired from [Dart's benchmark_harness](https://github.com/dart-lang/benchmark_harness). Unlike other benchmark utils, it runs for a specified period of time (2000ms by default) then returns the avg iteration time in microseconds. Here's an example usage comparing performance of maintaining a unique int collection between HashSet vs List:

```csharp
var rand = new Random();
var set = new HashSet<int>();
var avgMicroSecs = PerfUtils.Measure(
    () => set.Add(rand.Next(0, 1000)), runForMs:2000);

"HashSet: {0}us".Print(avgMicroSecs);

var list = new List<int>();
avgMicroSecs = PerfUtils.Measure(() => {
        int i = rand.Next(0, 1000);
        if (!list.Contains(i))
            list.Add(i);
    }, runForMs: 2000);

"List: {0}us".Print(avgMicroSecs);
```

### Minor Changes

- Numeric type mismatches between POCOs used in OrmLite and underlying RDBMS Tables are transparently coerced
- `Vary: Accept` is included in Global HTTP Headers to resolve browsers caching different Content-Type for the same url
- Razor configuration removes references to a specific version of ASP.NET Web Pages and adds `System` to default namespaces
- Swagger API emits an ApiVersion, configurable with `Config.ApiVersion` that defaults to "1.0"    
- Partials now render inside user-defined Razor sections
- Added `email.ToGravatarUrl()` extension method to retrieve avatar url from an email
- Replaced self-hosts use of ThreadStatics with CallContext to preserve Request scope in async requests
- Avoid runtime razor exceptions in Mono by not registering duplicate assemblies (i.e. from GAC) in RazorHost
- AppHostHttpListenerPoolBase self-host has a default pool size of `16 x Environment.ProcessorCount`
- ServiceStack's `IAppHost.CustomErrorHttpHandlers` can now override built-in HTTP Error handlers and fallback to generic error responses

### New Signed Projects

- [ServiceStack.ProtoBuf.Signed](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ServiceStack.ProtoBuf.Signed)

### Breaking Changes

- Moved `Config.GlobalHtmlErrorHttpHandler` to `IAppHost.GlobalHtmlErrorHttpHandler`
