## Redis ServerEvents

One limitation the default `MemoryServerEvents` implementation has is being limited for use within a single App Server where all client connections are maintained. This is no longer a limitation with the new **Redis ServerEvents back-end** which utilizes a distributed redis-server back-end to provide a scale-out option capable of serving fan-out/load-balanced App Servers. If you're familiar with SignalR, this is akin to [SignalR's scaleout with Redis back-end](http://www.asp.net/signalr/overview/signalr-20/performance-and-scaling/scaleout-with-redis).

`RedisServerEvents` is a drop-in replacement for the built-in `MemoryServerEvents` that's effectively a transparent implementation detail, invisible to Server or Client API's where both implementations even [share the same integration Tests](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/b9eb34eb80ff64fa1171d2f7f29ef359c3580eed/tests/ServiceStack.WebHost.Endpoints.Tests/ServerEventTests.cs#L169-L189).

![Redis ServerEvents Scale Out](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/gap/Chat/redis-scaleout.png)

### Enabling RedisServer Events

As a drop-in replacement it can easily be configured with just a few lines of code, as seen in the updated Chat App which can run on either [Memory or Redis ServerEvents providers](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/Chat/blob/326617e88272d7cc0a8b7513272cf055378957e2/src/Chat/Global.asax.cs#L46-L54):

```csharp
var redisHost = AppSettings.GetString("RedisHost");
if (redisHost != null)
{
    container.Register<IRedisClientsManager>(new PooledRedisClientManager(redisHost));

    container.Register<IServerEvents>(c => 
        new RedisServerEvents(c.Resolve<IRedisClientsManager>()));
    
    container.Resolve<IServerEvents>().Start();
}
```

The above configuration will use Redis ServerEvents if there's a `RedisHost` **appSetting** in Chat's [Web.config](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/Chat/blob/326617e88272d7cc0a8b7513272cf055378957e2/src/Chat/Web.config#L21):

```xml
<add key="RedisHost" value="localhost:6379" />
```

### Cross-platform Memory and Redis ServerEvent Enabled Chat.exe

To showcase Redis ServerEvents in action, we've prepared a stand-alone [ServiceStack.Gap](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Gap) version of [Chat](http://chat.netcore.io) compiled down into a single **Chat.exe** that can run on either Windows and OSX with Mono which can be downloaded from: 

### [Chat.zip](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Gap/raw/master/deploy/Chat.zip) (1.2MB)

[![Redis ServerEvents Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/release-notes/redis-server-events.gif)](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Gap/raw/master/deploy/Chat.zip)

> As Chat only runs on **2 back-end Services**, it fits well within [ServiceStack's Free Quota's](https://servicestack.net/download#free-quotas) which can be further customized and enhanced without a commercial license.

Running **Chat.exe** without any arguments will run Chat using the default **Memory ServerEvents**. This can be changed to use **Redis ServerEvents** by [un-commenting this line in appsettings.txt](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Gap/blob/master/src/Chat/Chat/appsettings.txt#L5):

```
#redis localhost
```

This will require a **redis-server** running on `localhost`. If you don't have redis yet, [download redis-server for Windows](https://github.com/ServiceStack/redis-windows).

Alternatively you can specify which **port** to run Chat on and change it to use Redis ServerEvents by specifying the **redis** instance it should connect to on the command-line with:

```
Chat.exe /port=1337 /redis=localhost
```

Also included in `Chat.zip` are [test-fanout-redis-events.bat](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Gap/blob/master/src/Chat/build/test-fanout-redis-events.bat) and equivalent [test-fanout-redis-events.sh](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Gap/blob/master/src/Chat/build/test-fanout-redis-events.sh) helper scripts for **spawning multiple versions of Chat.exe** on different ports (and backgrounds) for **Windows or OSX**, showing how multiple clients are able to send messages to each other via Redis whilst being subscribed to different HTTP Servers:

```
START Chat.exe /port=1337 /redis=localhost
START Chat.exe /port=2337 /redis=localhost /background=http://bit.ly/1oQqhtm
START Chat.exe /port=3337 /redis=localhost /background=http://bit.ly/1yIJOBH
```

This script was used to create the animated gif above to launch **3 self-hosting instances of Chat.exe** running on **different ports**, all connected to each other via Redis. This enables some interesting peer-to-peer scenarios where users are able to run a network of (CPU/resource isolated) decentralized stand-alone HTTP Servers on their local machines, but can still communicate with each other via redis.

## C# ServerEvents Client

Like ServiceStack's other [C# Service Clients](/csharp-client), the new `ServerEventsClient` is a [portable library](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/HelloMobile) contained in the `ServiceStack.Client` NuGet package:

```
PM> Install-Package ServiceStack.Client
```

And like the Service Clients it requires the `BaseUri` of your ServiceStack instance as well as an optional `channel` for the client to subscribe to:

```csharp
var client = new ServerEventsClient("http://chat.netcore.io", channel:"home");
```

### Managed Connection

The **C# ServerEvent Client** is a managed .NET client with feature parity with the [ServiceStack's JavaScript client](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/Chat#client-bindings---ss-utilsjs) that **auto-reconnects** when a connection is lost, **sends periodic heartbeats** to maintain an active subscription as well as **auto-unregistering** once the client stops listening for messages, or gets disposed.

### Handling Server Events

Unlike other C# clients, the ServerEvents Client is mainly reactive in that it's primarily waiting for Server Events to be initiated from a remote server instead of the typical scenario in which requests are initiated by clients. To maximize utility, there are a number of different API's to receive and process messages:

### Assigning Callback Handlers

One way to receive messages (useful in long-running clients) is to assign handlers for each of the different events that are fired. This example shows how to capture all the different events a Client can receive:

```csharp
ServerEventConnect connectMsg = null;
var msgs = new List<ServerEventMessage>();
var commands = new List<ServerEventMessage>();
var errors = new List<Exception>();

var client = new ServerEventsClient(baseUri) {
    OnConnect = e => connectMsg = e,
    OnCommand = commands.Add,
    OnMessage = msgs.Add,
    OnException = errors.Add,
}.Start();
```

Once the Client is configured, calling `Start()` will start listening for messages and calling `Stop()` or `Dispose()` will cancel the background HTTP connection and stop it listening for server events.

### Customizing Metadata sent to clients

As ServerEvents have deep integration with the rest of ServiceStack we're able to offer [Typed Messages](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/71b51d231d1ddb2ba7da39613e216ab75fd181c0/src/ServiceStack.Client/ServerEventsClient.cs#L14-L44) containing the users `UserAuthId`, `DisplayName` and `ProfileUrl` of the users avatar when it's available. The typed messages also offer an extensible `Dictionary<string,string> Meta` collection for maintaining custom metadata that can be sent to clients by appending to them in the ServerEventsFeature hooks, which can be defined when registering `ServerEventsFeature`:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new ServerEventsFeature { 
    // private Connect args
    OnConnect = (subscription,httpReq) => AppendTo(subscription.Meta),

    // public Join/Leave args
    OnCreated = (subscription,httpReq) => AppendTo(subscription.Meta), 
})
``` 

### Using C# Async/Await friendly API's

Depending on your use-case, if you only want to use the ServerEvent Client for a short-time to listen for predictable responses (i.e. waiting for a Server callback on a pending request) you can alternatively use the Task-based API's letting you to participate in C# async/await workflows:

```csharp
var client = new ServerEventsClient(baseUri, channel="Home");

// Wait to receive onConnect event
ServerEventConnect connectMsg = await client.Connect();

// Wait to receive onJoin command event
ServerEventCommand joinMsg = await client.WaitForNextCommand();

// Hold a future task to get notified once a msg has been received
Task<ServerEventMessage> msgTask = client1.WaitForNextMessage();

// Send a Web Service Request using the built-in JsonServiceClient
client.ServiceClient.Post(new PostChatToChannel {
    Channel = client.Channel,     // The channel we're listening on
    From = client.SubscriptionId, // SubscriptionId Populated after Connect() 
    Message = "Hello, World!",
});

// Wait till we receive the chat Msg event we sent earlier
ServerEventMessage msg = await msgTask;
```

The above example showcases the **3 Task-based API's** available:

  1. `Connect()` wait till receiving confirmation of a successful event subscription
  2. `WaitForNextCommand()` wait for the next `onJoin` or `onLeave` subscription events
  3. `WaitForNextMessage()` wait for the next message published to the channel

The `ServiceClient` property lets you access a `JsonServiceClient` that's pre-configured with the clients `BaseUri` so that is primed for Sending Web Service Requests with.

After the ServerEvent Client has connected, the `ConnectionInfo` property is populated with the typed `ServerEventConnect` response. 

### Message Event Handlers

The above examples show generic API's for receiving any type of message, but just like in the JavaScript client, more fine-grained API's are available for handling specific message types.

The `Handlers` dictionary is akin to the JavaScript Client's [Global Event Handlers](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/Chat#global-event-handlers) which specify lambda's to be executed when messages are sent with the `cmd.*` selector:

```csharp
client.Handlers["chat"] = (client, msg) => {
    var chatMsg = msg.Json.FromJson<ChatMessage>(); //Deserialize JSON string to typed DTO
    "Received '{0}' from '{1}'".Print(chatMsg.Message, chatMsg.FromName);
};
```

Roughly translates to the equivalent JavaScript below:

```javascript
$(source).handleServerEvents({
    handlers: {
        chat: function (msg, event) {
            console.log("Received " + msg.message + " from " + msg.fromName);
        }
    }
});
```

Where both methods handle the `ChatMessage` sent with the `cmd.chat` selector.

### Named Receivers

Whilst handlers provide a light way to handle loose-typed messages, there's a more structured and typed option that works similar to ServiceStack's `IService` classes but are used to instead handle typed Server Event Messages. 

To be able to handle messages with your own classes, get them to implement the `IReceiver` empty marker interface:

```csharp
public interface IReceiver
{
    void NoSuchMethod(string selector, object message);
}
```

Whilst primarily a marker interface, `IReceiver` does include a `NoSuchMethod` API to be able to handle messages sent with a unknown selector **target** that doesn't match any defined method or property.

**Named Receivers** are equivalent to [Receivers](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/Chat#receivers) in the JavaScript client which can be assigned to handle all messages sent to a receiver with the selector format:

```
{receiver}.{target}
```

A Named Receiver can be registered with the API below:

```csharp
client.RegisterNamedReceiver<TestNamedReceiver>("test");
```

Which will forward all messages with a `test.*` selector to an instance of the `TestNamedReceiver` Type

```csharp
public class TestNamedReceiver : ServerEventReceiver
{
    public void FooMethod(CustomType request) {} // void return type

    public CustomType BarMethod(CustomType request)
    {        
        return request; // works with any return type, which are ignored
    }

    public CustomType BazSetter { get; set; } // Auto populate properties

    public override void NoSuchMethod(string selector, object message)
    {
        var msg = (ServerEventMessage)message;
        var nonExistentMethodCustomType = msg.Json.FromJson<CustomType>();
    }
}
```

This is roughly equivalent to the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
$(source).handleServerEvents({
    receivers: {
        test: {
            FooMethod: function (msg, event) { ... },
            BarMethod: function (msg, event) { ... },
            BazSetter: null,            
        }
    }
});
```

> The [ServerEventReceiver](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/68c7159037e7cf2a519d482b7dae524ca073da20/src/ServiceStack.Client/ServerEventsClient.Receiver.cs#L16-L28) is a convenient base class that in addition to implementing `IReceiver` interface, gets injected with the `Client` as well as additional context about the raw message available in `base.Request`.

#### Unknown Message Handling

One difference in the JavaScript client is that messages with **unknown** targets are assigned as properties on the `test` receiver, e.g `test.QuxTarget = {..}`.

### Sending messages to Named Receivers

Once registered, an instance of `TestNamedReceiver` will process messages sent with a `test.*` selector. The example below shows how to send a DTO to each of `TestNamedReceiver` defined methods and properties:

```csharp
public class MyEventServices : Service
{
    public IServerEvents ServerEvents { get; set; }

    public void Any(CustomType request)
    {
        ServerEvents.NotifyChannel("home", "test.FooMethod", request);
        ServerEvents.NotifyChannel("home", "test.BarMethod", request);
        ServerEvents.NotifyChannel("home", "test.BazSetter", request);

        ServerEvents.NotifyChannel("home", "test.QuxTarget", request);
    }
}
```

### Life-cycle of Receivers

Similar to **Services** in ServiceStack, each message is processed with an instance of the Receiver that's resolved from `ServerEventsClient.Resolver` which by default uses the [NewInstanceResolver](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/ec0226b97227048c3bd7c24667a71e7af7e1ff31/src/ServiceStack.Client/ServerEventsClient.Receiver.cs#L30-L36) to execute messages using a new instance of the Receiver Type: 

```csharp
public class NewInstanceResolver : IResolver
{
    public T TryResolve<T>()
    {
        return typeof(T).CreateInstance<T>();
    }
}
```

This can be changed to re-use the same instance by assigning a [SingletonInstanceResolver](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/ec0226b97227048c3bd7c24667a71e7af7e1ff31/src/ServiceStack.Client/ServerEventsClient.Receiver.cs#L38-L46) instead:

```csharp
public class SingletonInstanceResolver : IResolver
{
    ConcurrentDictionary<Type, object> Cache = new ConcurrentDictionary<Type, object>();

    public T TryResolve<T>()
    {
        return (T)Cache.GetOrAdd(typeof(T), type => type.CreateInstance<T>());
    }
}

client.Resolver = new SingletonInstanceResolver();
```

We can also have it resolve instances from your preferred IOC. Here's an example showing how to register all Receiver Types, auto-wire them with any custom dependencies, and instruct the client to resolve instances from our IOC:

```csharp
// Register all Receivers:
client.RegisterNamedReceiver<TestNamedReceiver>("test");
...

// Register all dependencies used in a new Funq.Container:
var container = new Container();
container.RegisterAs<Dependency, IDependency>();

// Go through an auto-wire all Registered Receiver Types with Funq:
container.RegisterAutoWiredTypes(client.ReceiverTypes);

// Change the client to resolve receivers from the new Funq Container:
client.Resolver = container;
```

We can assign `Funq.Container` directly as it already implements the [IResolver](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Interfaces/Configuration/IResolver.cs) interface, whilst you can re-use the existing IOC **Container Adapters** to [enable support for other IOCs](/ioc#use-another-ioc-container).

### The Global Receiver

Whilst Named Receivers are used to handle messages sent to a specific namespaced selector, the client also supports registering a **Global Receiver** for handling messages sent with the special `cmd.*` selector.

#### Handling Messages with the Default Selector

All `IServerEvents` Notify API's inlcudes [overloads for sending messages without a selector](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/ServerEventsFeature.cs#L743-L771) that by convention will take the format `cmd.{TypeName}`. 

These events can be handled with a Global Receiver **based on Message type**, e.g:

```csharp
public class GlobalReceiver : ServerEventReceiver
{
    public SetterType AnyNamedProperty { get; set; }

    public void AnyNamedMethod(CustomType request)
    {
        ...
    }
}

client.RegisterReceiver<GlobalReceiver>();
```

Which will be called when messages are sent without a selector, e.g:

```csharp
public class MyServices : Service
{
    public IServerEvents ServerEvents { get; set; }

    public void Any(Request request)
    {
        ServerEvents.NotifyChannel("home", new CustomType { ... });
        ServerEvents.NotifyChannel("home", new SetterType { ... });
    }
}
```

As Global Receivers handle other messages sent with the `cmd.*` selector and can be re-used as a named receiver, we can define a single class to handle all the different custom messages sent in [chat.netcore.io](http://chat.netcore.io) App, E.g:

```
cmd.chat Hi
cmd.announce This is your captain speaking...
cmd.toggle#channels
css.background-image url(https://servicestack.net/img/bg.jpg)
...
```

The above messages can all be handled with the Receiver below:

```csharp
public class JavaScriptReceiver : ServerEventReceiver
{
    public void Chat(ChatMessage message) { ... }
    public void Announce(string message) { ... }
    public void Toggle(string message) { ... }
    public void BackgroundImage(string cssRule) { ... }
}

client.RegisterNamedReceiver<JavaScriptReceiver>();
client.RegisterNamedReceiver<JavaScriptReceiver>("css");
```

As seen above the **target** names are **case-insensitive** and `-` are collapsed to cater for JavaScript/CSS naming conventions.

## ServiceStack.Redis

### Redis Pub/Sub Server

To power RedisServerEvents we've extracted the managed Pub/Sub long-running message-loop originally built for [Redis MQ](/redis-mq) and encapsulated it into a re-usable class that can be used independently for handling messages published to specific [Redis Pub/Sub](http://redis.io/commands#pubsub) channels.

`RedisPubSubServer` processes messages in a managed background thread that **automatically reconnects** when the redis-server connection fails and works like an independent background Service that can be stopped and started on command. 

The public API is captured in the [IRedisPubSubServer](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Interfaces/Redis/IRedisPubSubServer.cs) interface:

```csharp
public interface IRedisPubSubServer : IDisposable
{
    IRedisClientsManager ClientsManager { get; }
    // What Channels it's subscribed to
    string[] Channels { get; }

    // Run once on initial StartUp
    Action OnInit { get; set; }
    // Called each time a new Connection is Started
    Action OnStart { get; set; }
    // Invoked when Connection is broken or Stopped
    Action OnStop { get; set; }
    // Invoked after Dispose()
    Action OnDispose { get; set; }

    // Fired when each message is received
    Action<string, string> OnMessage { get; set; }
    // Fired after successfully subscribing to the specified channels
    Action<string> OnUnSubscribe { get; set; }
    // Called when an exception occurs 
    Action<Exception> OnError { get; set; }
    // Called before attempting to Failover to a new redis master
    Action<IRedisPubSubServer> OnFailover { get; set; }

    int? KeepAliveRetryAfterMs { get; set; }
    // The Current Time for RedisServer
    DateTime CurrentServerTime { get; }

    // Current Status: Starting, Started, Stopping, Stopped, Disposed
    string GetStatus();
    // Different life-cycle stats
    string GetStatsDescription();
    
    // Subscribe to specified Channels and listening for new messages
    IRedisPubSubServer Start();
    // Close active Connection and stop running background thread
    void Stop();
    // Stop than Start
    void Restart();
}
```

To use `RedisPubSubServer`, initialize it with the channels you want to subscribe to and assign handlers for each of the events you want to handle. At a minimum you'll want to handle `OnMessage`:

```csharp
var clientsManager = new PooledRedisClientManager();
var redisPubSub = new RedisPubSubServer(clientsManager, "channel-1", "channel-2") {
        OnMessage = (channel, msg) => "Received '{0}' from '{1}'".Print(msg, channel)
    }.Start();
```

Calling `Start()` after it's initialized will get it to start listening and processing any messages published to the subscribed channels.

## [App Settings](/appsettings)

For many years our solution against using .NET's complex XML configuration for App configuration is to store structured configuration in the **Web.config** appSettings which thanks to the [JSV format](/jsv-format) makes it easy to read and write structured data from a single string value, e.g:

```xml
<appSettings>
    <add key="String" value="Foo"/>
    <add key="Int" value="42"/>
    <add key="List" value="A,B,C,D,E"/>
    <add key="Dict" value="A:1,B:2,C:3"/>
    <add key="Poco" value="{Foo:Bar}"/>
</appSettings>
```

This can be easily parsed into C# types with the [IAppSettings](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Interfaces/Configuration/IAppSettings.cs) API:

```csharp
IAppSettings settings = new AppSettings();

string value = settings.Get("String");
int value = settings.Get("Int", defaultValue:1);
List<string> values = settings.GetList("List");
Dictionary<string,string> valuesMap = settings.GetDictionary("Dict");
MyConfig config = settings.Get("Poco", new MyConfig { Foo = "Baz" });
```

Like other ServiceStack providers, `IAppSettings` is a clean interface with multiple providers letting you easily change or override where you want to source your App configuration from:

  - **DictionarySettings** - Maintain settings in an in-memory Dictionary
  - **TextFileSettings** - Maintain settings in a plain-text file
  - **OrmLiteAppSettings** - Maintain settings in any RDBMS `Config` table

We take advantage of this in our [public OSS projects](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/Chat) when we want to override [public appSettings with production settings](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/HttpBenchmarks/blob/master/src/BenchmarksAnalyzer/Global.asax.cs#L29-L32) or in our [stand-alone Applications](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Gap) by allowing us to ship our applications with more end-user friendly **plain-text config file** whose defaults are embedded in the stand-alone **.exe**, exporting it if it doesn't exist - letting us achieve a single, portable **.exe** that can be xcopy'ed and run as-is.

### First class AppSettings

After proving its value over the years we've decided to make it a first-class property on `IAppHost.AppSettings` which defaults to looking at .NET's App/Web.config's. 

The new [Chat.zip](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Gap/raw/master/deploy/Chat.zip) App explores different ways AppSettings can be used: 

If there's an existing `appsettings.txt` file where the **.exe** is run it will use that, otherwise it falls back to **Web.config** appSettings:

```csharp
public AppHost() : base("Chat", typeof (ServerEventsServices).Assembly)
{
    var customSettings = new FileInfo("appsettings.txt");
    AppSettings = customSettings.Exists
        ? (IAppSettings)new TextFileSettings(customSettings.FullName)
        : new AppSettings();
}
```

As a normal property in your AppHost, AppSettings can be accessed directly in `AppHost.Configure()`:

```csharp
public void Configure(Container container)
{
    ...
    var redisHost = AppSettings.GetString("RedisHost");
    if (redisHost != null)
    {
        container.Register<IServerEvents>(c => 
            new RedisServerEvents(new PooledRedisClientManager(redisHost)));
        
        container.Resolve<IServerEvents>().Start();
    }
}
```

Inside your services or IOC dependencies, like any other auto-wired dependency:

```csharp
public class ServerEventsServices : Service
{
    public IAppSettings AppSettings { get; set; }

    public void Any(PostRawToChannel request)
    {
        if (!IsAuthenticated && AppSettings.Get("LimitRemoteControlToAuthenticatedUsers", false))
            throw new HttpError(HttpStatusCode.Forbidden, "You must be authenticated to use remote control.");
        ...
    }   
}
```

Directly within Razor views:

```html
<style>
    body {
        background-image: url(@AppSettings.Get("background","/img/bg.jpg")) 
    }
</style>
```

As well as outside ServiceStack, via the `HostContext` static class:

```csharp
var redisHost = HostContext.AppSettings.GetString("redis");
```

### AppSettings are now writable

A new `Set()` API was added to [IAppSettings](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Interfaces/Configuration/IAppSettings.cs) letting you save any serializable property that works for all providers:

```csharp
public interface IAppSettings
{
    void Set<T>(string key, T value);
    ...
}

AppSettings.Set("Poco", new MyConfig { Foo = "Baz" });
```

In providers that support writable configuration natively like `OrmLiteAppSettings` and `DictionarySettings`, the settings get written through to the underlying provider. For read-only providers like Web.config's `AppSettings` or `TextFileSettings` a **shadowed** cache is kept that works similar to prototypal shadowing in JavaScript where if a property doesn't exist, setting a property will be stored on the top-level object instance which also takes precedence on subsequent property access.

## [Metadata Pages](/metadata-page)

The metadata pages have been expanded to include some of [Swagger API Attribute annotations](/swagger-api#swagger-attributes) which now shows the parameters for the Request and Response DTO's as well as any other DTO's used in each metadata operation page:

![Metadata Type Info](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/release-notes/metadata-swagger-api.png)

When annotated the Description also shows any **allowable Enum values** or **range limits** when provided.

#### HtmlFormat

The humanize feature in [Auto HtmlFormat](/html5reportformat) for splitting JoinedCase words with spaces can be disabled for all pages with:

```csharp
HtmlFormat.Humanize = false;
``` 

Or on adhoc pages by adding `#dehumanize` hash param.

## [Authentication](/authentication-and-authorization)

### Web Sudo

A common UX in some websites is to add an extra layer of protection for **super protected** functionality by getting users to re-confirm their password verifying it's still them using the website, common in places like confirming a financial transaction. 

**WebSudo** (by [@tvjames](https://github.com/tvjames)) is a new feature similar in spirit requiring users to re-authenticate when accessing Services annotated with the `[WebSudoRequired]` attribute. To make use of WebSudo, first register the plugin:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new WebSudoFeature());
```

You can then apply WebSudo behavior to existing services by annotating them with `[WebSudoRequired]`:

```csharp
[WebSudoRequired]
public class RequiresWebSudoService : Service
{
    public object Any(RequiresWebSudo request)
    {
        return request;
    }
}
```

Once enabled this will throw a **402 Web Sudo Required** HTTP Error the first time the service is called:

```csharp
var requiresWebSudo = new RequiresWebSudo { Name = "test" };
try
{
    client.Send<RequiresWebSudoResponse>(requiresWebSudo); //throws
}
catch (WebServiceException)
{
    client.Send(authRequest); //re-authenticate
    var response = client.Send(requiresWebSudo); //success!
}
```

Re-authenticating afterwards will allow access to the WebSudo service.

### Auth Events

In order to enable functionality like **WebSudo** we've added additional hooks into the Authentication process with `IAuthEvents`:

```csharp
public interface IAuthEvents
{
    void OnRegistered(IRequest httpReq, IAuthSession session, IServiceBase registrationService);

    void OnAuthenticated(IRequest httpReq, IAuthSession session, IServiceBase authService, 
        IAuthTokens tokens, Dictionary<string, string> authInfo);

    void OnLogout(IRequest httpReq, IAuthSession session, IServiceBase authService);

    void OnCreated(IRequest httpReq, IAuthSession session);
}
```

These are the same authentication hooks that were previously only available when creating a **Custom UserSession** by inheriting [AuthUserSession](/sessions#session-events). The new AuthEvents API provide a loose-typed way where plugins can tap into the same hooks by registering it with `AuthFeature.AuthEvents`, e.g:

```csharp
public class WebSudoFeature : IPlugin, IAuthEvents
{
    public void Register(IAppHost appHost)
    {
        ...
        var authFeature = appHost.GetPlugin<AuthFeature>();
        authFeature.AuthEvents.Add(this);
    }

    // Add implementations on `IAuthEvents` handlers
    public void OnCreated(IRequest httpReq, IAuthSession session)
    {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

An alternative way for accessing `IAuthEvents` is to register it like a normal dependency, e.g:

```csharp
container.RegisterAs<LogAuthEvents,IAuthEvents>();
```

To simplify custom implementations you can inherit from the empty concrete [AuthEvents](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/7eb3a34a2e545a54c2591665328c16c5d398d37a/src/ServiceStack/Auth/AuthEvents.cs#L18-L25) and choose to only implement the callbacks you're interested in, e.g:

```csharp
public class LogAuthEvents : AuthEvents
{
    public static ILog Log = LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(LogAuthEvents));

    public override void OnLogout(IRequest httpReq, IAuthSession session, IServiceBase authService) 
    {
        Log.DebugFormat("User #{0} {1} has logged out", session.UserAuthId, session.UserName);
    }
}
```

## OrmLite

  - Added new `db.ColumnLazy` API for lazily fetching a column of data
  - Added `db.TableExists<T>` for a typed API to detect whether a table exists
  - Added `INamingStrategy.GetSequenceName()` to [override how sequence names in Oracle are generated](http://stackoverflow.com/a/25611452/85785)
  - Upgraded PostgreSql Provider to **Npgsql 2.2.0** and Sqlite to **Sqlite.Core 1.0.93.0**

## Text

  - Added `JsConfig.ParsePrimitiveIntegerTypes` and `JsConfig.ParsePrimitiveFloatingPointTypes` to [change preferences on what primitive numeric types should be converted to](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Text/pull/428).
  - Added `JsConfig.IgnoreAttributesNamed` to [change what attributes are used to ignore properties](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Text/commit/3b9972fbd61ce000f9af72d74d79b30eb0d2f45b)
  - Added [string.CountOccurancesOf() extension method](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Text/commit/d41d7fb879d68e5a4ccb529e3cc6ed7d3ce937a2)
  - Added [Image MimeTypes](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Text/commit/b07cf033d7b4735b0249850769b119be0c857b9d)

## Community

## [ServiceStack MiniProfiler Toolkit](https://bitbucket.org/migajek/miniprofilingtoolkit)

From the wider ServiceStack Community, [Michał Gajek](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Micha%C5%82Gajek/auto) has developed an alternative analyzer of ServiceStack's MiniProfiler results in a comprehensive UI that allows deep introspection of your running Services. From the Project's description:

### Description

This project intends to provide tools for collecting & analyzing profiling results of ServiceStack-based apps.
Not only this makes profiling possible in the scenario when no built-in web-frontend is available (like Single Page Applications), but also has several advantages over it:

 - collects & persists the results
 - allows the "background" profiling (example: production environment)
 - it's better to analyze large amounts of collected profiling results, not just focusing on single execution timings
 - helps finding time-consuming queries
