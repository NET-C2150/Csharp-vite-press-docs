Thanks to the simplicity, elegance, strong typing and philosophy of both solutions, FSharp and ServiceStack are quickly becoming a popular choice for creating friction-less REST and message-based remote services.

### .NET Core F# Project

You can create a new .NET Core F# project in a new empty directory using the [x dotnet tool](https://docs.servicestack.net/dotnet-tool) with:

```bash
$ dotnet tool install --global x 
$ mkdir ProjectName && cd ProjectName
$ x mix init-fsharp
$ dotnet run
```


Which will download the [init-fsharp Gist](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/4802ba22b665e68c7257aef9f57c1934) to your local directory 
where you can use its dep-free [/index.html](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/4802ba22b665e68c7257aef9f57c1934#file-wwwroot-index-html) and its
`JsonServiceClient` to call its **/hello** API:

### [Complete F# Console Self-Host Example](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Test/blob/713f1e2c9fce2351446b168d39fe8b0248f252fc/src/VS.FSharp.SelfHost/Program.fs)

For .NET Framework you can use the `AppSelfHostBase` to create a stand-alone self-hosted Console App:

```fsharp
open System
open ServiceStack

type Hello = { mutable Name: string; }
type HelloResponse = { mutable Result: string; }
type HelloService() =
    interface IService
    member this.Any (req:Hello) = { Result = "Hello, " + req.Name }

//Define the Web Services AppHost
type AppHost =
    inherit AppSelfHostBase
    new() = { inherit AppSelfHostBase("Hi F#!", typeof<HelloService>.Assembly) }
    override this.Configure container =
        base.Routes
            .Add<Hello>("/hello")
            .Add<Hello>("/hello/{Name}") |> ignore

//Run it!
[<EntryPoint>]
let main args =
    let host = if args.Length = 0 then "http://*:1337/" else args.[0]
    printfn "listening on %s ..." host
    let appHost = new AppHost()
    appHost.Init() |> ignore
    appHost.Start host |> ignore
    Console.ReadLine() |> ignore
    0
```
