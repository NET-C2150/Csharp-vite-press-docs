ServiceStack's [HTML5 JSON Report Format](/html5reportformat) also includes the excellent [Mvc Mini Profiler](http://code.google.com/p/mvc-mini-profiler/) - by [@jarrod_dixon](https://twitter.com/jarrod_dixon) and [@samsaffron](https://twitter.com/samsaffron).
It's the same profiler used to profile and help speed up sites like [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) and more recently the much faster [NuGet v2.0](http://nuget.org) website.

The MVC Mini Profiler plugin is only available for classic ASP.NET Framework Web Apps, for .NET Core Apps you can use the official [MiniProfiler.AspNetCore.Mvc](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MiniProfiler.AspNetCore.Mvc) NuGet package, please see this community post for details:

 - [Servicestack + Miniprofiler + .NET Core + Angular](http://inayearorso.io/2018/04/18/servicestack-miniprofiler-dotnetcore-angular2/)

### Using the MVC Mini Profiler

Just like the [Normal Mvc Mini Profiler](http://code.google.com/p/mvc-mini-profiler/) you can enable it by registering the `MiniProfilerFeature` Plugin:

```csharp
// In ServiceStack.NetFramework package, not available for .NET Core
Plugins.Add(new MiniProfilerFeature());  
```

Then starting it in your Global.asax, here's how to enable it for local requests:

```csharp
protected void Application_BeginRequest(object src, EventArgs e)
{
    if (Request.IsLocal)
        Profiler.Start();
}

protected void Application_EndRequest(object src, EventArgs e)
{
    Profiler.Stop();
}
```

Now if you also have ServiceStack Razor views you can enable the profiler by putting this into your _Layout.cshtml page:

```csharp
@ServiceStack.MiniProfiler.Profiler.RenderIncludes().AsRaw() 
```

That's it! Now every time you view a web service or a razor page in your browser (locally) you'll see a profiler view of your service broken down in different stages:

![Hello MiniProfiler](/images/advanced/miniprofiler-hello.png)

By default you get to see how long it took ServiceStack to de-serialize your request, run any Request / Response Filters and more importantly how long it took to **Execute** your service.

## SQL Profiling

The profiler includes special support for SQL Profiling that can easily be enabled for OrmLite and Dapper by getting it to use a Profiled Connection using a ConnectionFilter:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new MiniProfilerFeature()); // Register before using ProfiledDbConnection

this.Container.Register<IDbConnectionFactory>(c =>
    new OrmLiteConnectionFactory(
        "~/App_Data/db.sqlite".MapHostAbsolutePath(), SqliteDialect.Provider) {
            ConnectionFilter = x => new ProfiledDbConnection(x, Profiler.Current)
    });
```

Refer to the [Main MVC MiniProfiler home page](http://code.google.com/p/mvc-mini-profiler/) for instructions on how to configure profiling for Linq2Sql and EntityFramework.

It's also trivial to add custom steps enabling even finer-grained profiling for your services. 
Here's a [simple web service DB example](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/tests/ServiceStack.WebHost.IntegrationTests/Services/ProfilerService.cs) 
returning a list of Movies using both a simple DB query and a dreaded N+1 query.

```csharp
public class MiniProfiler
{
    public string Type { get; set; }
}

public class MiniProfilerService : Service
{
    public object Any(MiniProfiler request)
    {
        var profiler = Profiler.Current;

        using (profiler.Step("MiniProfiler Service"))
        {
            if (request.Type == "n1")
            {
                using (profiler.Step("N + 1 query"))
                {
                    var results = new List<Movie>();
                    foreach (var movie in Db.Select<Movie>())
                    {
                        results.Add(Db.QueryById<Movie>(movie.Id));
                    }
                    return results;
                }
            }

            using (profiler.Step("Simple Select all"))
            {
                return Db.Select<Movie>();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## View executed SQL

Calling the above service normally provides the following Profiler output:

![Simple DB Example](/images/advanced/miniprofiler-simpledb.png)

Whilst calling the service with the **n1** param yields the following warning:

![Simple N+1 DB Example](/images/advanced/miniprofiler-simpledb-n1.png)

In both cases you see the actual SQL statements performed by clicking the **SQL** link. The N+1 query provides shows the following:

Notice the special attention the MVC MiniProfiler team put into identifying **Duplicate** queries - Thanks Guys!
