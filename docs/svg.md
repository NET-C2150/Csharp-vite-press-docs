ServiceStack lets you register use built-in and register custom SVG icons from the `Svg` static API class.

A common performance drain in Web Apps is serving images whose large binary blobs can have a significant impact on your App's 
Request throughput, and why they're often hosted behind CDN's which can complicate the deployment process and introduce subtle caching issues.

A popular image format that's seen its popularity rise on the Web is SVG - a text vector image format that scales beautifully to support
different resolutions. SVG's are typically small in size and have great support in browsers where they can be optimally cached in `.css` 
style sheets to reduce the number of required image requests.

Unless you're using an npm based build system there hasn't been great support for managing SVG images in .NET beyond treating them
as individual images, that is until now with the new `SvgFeature` plugin (pre-registered by default) and the `Svg` class - providing programmatic 
access to registering SVG image collections and accessing them in a variety of different formats and colors.

### In Memory Bundled CSS files

`SvgFeature` works by creating an in memory bundled `.css` file for each "image set" that's registered at the path `/css/{image-set}.css`, 
e.g. it's pre-configured with the **svg-auth** and **svg-icons** svg groups:

  - **/css/svg-auth.css** - Vendor Icons for each of the popular 3rd Party OAuth Providers
  - **/css/svg-icons.css** - Generic User Avatars (used as the default profile image)

SVG files are simply stored as strings in regular collections maintained in `Svg.CssFiles` and `Svg.Images` dictionaries which can be modified/extended as normal.

### Viewing SVG Icons

One thing that sets SVG apart from normal images is the multitude of ways they can be referenced. SVG's are commonly bundled in 
`.css` files and referenced by classes, but they can also be embedded in a native `<img>` tag and `<svg>` block element where they
can be displayed in different colors.

To make it as easy as possible to reference SVG images in different contexts we've created the dynamic `/metadata/svg` page 
(also available under the **SVG Images** link in your [/metadata page Debug Links](/metadata-page#debug-links)) where you can view
all your App's registered SVG images complete with different usage examples, code fragments and links to access SVG Image `.css` 
collections or individual SVG images:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/svg/metadata-svg.png)

The **entire page is clickable** where you can first click on the SVG image you want to use then **click on any text fragment** to copy it, 
ready for pasting it in your web page.

### Loading SVG from FileSystem

The most user-friendly way to load custom SVG images is to load them from a custom directory, e.g:

    /svg
        /svg-icons
            vue.svg
            spirals.html
        /my-icons
            myicon.svg

Then in your `AppHost` you can register all SVG images using `Svg.Load()`:

```csharp
public override void Configure(Container container)
{
    Svg.Load(RootDirectory.GetDirectory("/svg"));
}
```

> `VirtualFiles` is configured to your projects **ContentRoot**, use `VirtualFileSources` to use your **WebRoot**, 
> `RootDirectory` uses the FileSystem VFS in `VirtualFileSources` whereas `ContentRootDirectory` looks in `VirtualFiles`

This will load all the SVG images in the `/svg` directory with the **sub directory** used for the **cssfile** (aka image-set) 
you want to add them to and the **file name** (without extension) used as the SVG identifier.

It will also evaluate any `.html` files in the directory with [#Script](https://sharpscript.net) and add the rendered SVG output,
e.g. we can load the generated SVG from the [Spirals Sharp App](https://github.com/mythz/spirals):

##### /svg/svg-icons/spirals.html

```hbs
{% raw %}<svg height="640" width="240">
{{#each range(180) }}
    {{ 120 + 100 * cos((5)  * it * 0.02827) | to => x }}
    {{ 320 + 300 * sin((1)  * it * 0.02827) | to => y }}
    <circle cx="{{x}}" cy="{{y}}" r="{{it*0.1}}" fill="#556080" stroke="black" stroke-width="1"></circle>
{{/each}}
</svg>{% endraw %}
```

and the SVG rendered output will be registered as a normal static SVG Image.

### Registering SVGs from _init.html

An alternative way of registering SVG's is to register them in #Script Pages `_init.html` page that gets executed once on Startup
which will let you register multiple SVG images within 1 file using the `#svg` Script Block using the format `#svg <name> <image-set>`, e.g:

```hbs
{% raw %}{{#svg vue app}}
<svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <g>
        <path fill="#556080" stroke="null" d="m79.43253,10.80794l0.01231,-0.02461l-18.15085,0l-11.38274,19.68085l0,0.0082l-11.37043,-19.68906l-18.15085,0l0,0.02051l-19.70136,0l49.22265,85.26183l49.22265,-85.25773"/>
    </g>
</svg>
{{/svg}}{% endraw %}
```

Which also supports using `#Script` to create and register dynamically rendered SVG images:

```hbs
{% raw %}{{#svg spirals svg-icons}}
<svg height="640" width="240">
{{#each range(180) }}
    {{ 120 + 100 * cos((5)  * it * 0.02827) | to => x }}
    {{ 320 + 300 * sin((1)  * it * 0.02827) | to => y }}
    <circle cx="{{x}}" cy="{{y}}" r="{{it*0.1}}" fill="#556080" stroke="black" stroke-width="1"></circle>
{{/each}}
</svg>
{{/svg}}{% endraw %}
```

### Register Custom SVG Images via API

You can also register your own SVG images programmatically with:

```csharp
Svg.AddImage("<svg width='100' height='100' viewBox='0 0 100 100'>...</svg>", "myicon", "my-icons");
```

Where it will register the SVG under the **myicon** name and include it in the `/css/my-icons.css` css file.

The same icon can also be included in multiple stylesheets by adding its name to the `Svg.CssFiles` collection, e.g:

```csharp
Svg.CssFiles["svg-icons"].Add("myicon");
```

#### SVG APIs

Once added you can access your SVG images from the available `Svg` APIs:

```csharp
var svg = Svg.GetImage("myicon");
var dataUri = Svg.GetDataUri("myicon");
```

All SVG images are also available from the `Svg.Images` collection if you need to access them programmatically:

```csharp
foreach (var entry in Svg.Images) {
    var name = entry.Key;
    var svg = entry.Value;
    $"{name}: {svg}".Print();
}
```

#### Recommended SVG conventions

All built-in SVG's are `100x100` in size, it's not necessary but for consistency it's good for your SVG icons also retain the same size, 
but as they're vector images they can be easily resized when referencing them in your App.

If your icons use the **fill** colors registered in:

```csharp
Svg.FillColors = new[] { "#ffffff", "#556080" };
```

You will be able replace the fill colors with:

```csharp
var svg = Svg.GetImage("myicon", "#e33");
var dataUri = Svg.GetDataUri("myicon", "#e33");
```

## Using SVG images in CSS

On Startup ServiceStack generates `.css` files for all SVG icons in `Svg.CssFiles` so you can import all icons with a single 
stylesheet reference with all icons in each CSS file available from `/css/{name}.css`, e.g:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/svg-icons.css">
```

Each CSS file includes 2 CSS classes for each SVG image that are both configured with the SVG as a background image:

```css
.svg-myicon, .fa-myicon { background-image: url(...) }
```

Use the `svg-myicon` class when you want to set an HTML Element to use your SVG as its background:

```html
<div class="icon svg-myicon"></div>
```

A good way to set the size of all related icons is to use a shared class, e.g:

```css
.icon {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-size: 50px 50px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: 2px 2px;
}
```

The `fa-myicon` class follows [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) convention which you can use to render SVG icons inside buttons, e.g:

```html
<button class="btn btn-block btn-social btn-light">
  <i class="fab fa-myicon"></i> Label
</button>
```

You can either use [Bootstrap Button colors](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/buttons/#examples) to select the button color
you want or use a custom `btn-myicon` class to choose different backgrounds for each SVG, e.g:

```css
.btn-myicon {
  color: #212529;
  background-color: #dae0e5;
  border-color: #d3d9df;
}
```

The buttons requires the [Social Buttons for Bootstrap](https://lipis.github.io/bootstrap-social/) which is also embedded in ServiceStack.dll
that can be referenced from `/css/buttons.css`, e.g:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/buttons.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/svg-icons.css">
```

### Inline CSS

An alternative to using external stylesheet references above, is to embed them as inline styles in your page which can benefit in reduced
network requests as well as provide better isolation than including all CSS your App's use in each page.

You can use `cssIncludes` to embed the contents of multiple css files in `#Script` pages with:

```hbs
{% raw %}{{ 'buttons,svg-icons' | cssIncludes }}{% endraw %}
```

Or in Razor with:

```html
@Html.CssIncludes("buttons","svg-icons")
```

## Using SVG images in `#Script`

In [#Script Pages](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-pages) you can embed SVG xml with the `svgImage` and `svgDataUri` scripts:

```hbs
{% raw %}{{ 'myicon' | svgImage }}
{{ 'myicon'.svgImage('#e33') }}{% endraw %}
```

Inside an HTML IMG element using its data URI:

```html
{% raw %}<img src="{{ 'myicon'.svgDataUri() }}">
<img src="{{ 'myicon'.svgDataUri('#e33') }}">{% endraw %}
```

Or as a background image in a custom CSS class:

```css
{% raw %}.myicon {
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
  background-size: 142px;
  background-position: 4px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  {{ 'myicon'.svgBackgroundImageCss() }} 
}{% endraw %}
```

Where you can use the class name to apply the above CSS to an element:

```html
<div class="myicon"></div>
```

### Using SVG images in Razor

Likewise there are HTML Helpers with the same name available in Razor Pages, where you can embed SVG images directly with:

```csharp
@Html.SvgImage("myicon")
@Html.SvgImage("myicon", "#e33")
```

Inside an HTML IMG element using its data URI:

```html
<img src='@Html.SvgDataUri("myicon")'>
<img src='@Html.SvgDataUri("myicon", "#e33")'>
```

Or inside a CSS class:

```css
.myicon {
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
  background-size: 150px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  @Html.SvgBackgroundImageCss("myicon")
}
```

### Server Controls

Use these `#Script` methods to reference and modify individual SVG images in [#Script Pages](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-pages):

```csharp
svgImage(string name) => Svg.GetImage(name)
svgImage(string name, string fillColor) => Svg.GetImage(name, fillColor)
svgDataUri(string name) => Svg.GetDataUri(name)
svgDataUri(string name, string fillColor) => Svg.GetDataUri(name, fillColor)
svgFill(string svg, string color) => Svg.Fill(svg, color)

svgBackgroundImageCss(string name) => Svg.GetBackgroundImageCss(name)
svgBackgroundImageCss(string name, string fillColor) => Svg.GetBackgroundImageCss(name, fillColor)
svgInBackgroundImageCss(string svg) => Svg.InBackgroundImageCss(svg)

svgBaseUrl(ScriptScopeContext scope) => 
    req(scope).ResolveAbsoluteUrl(HostContext.AssertPlugin<SvgFeature>().RoutePath);

Dictionary<string, string> svgImages() => Svg.Images;
Dictionary<string, string> svgDataUris() => Svg.DataUris;
Dictionary<string, List<string>> svgCssFiles() => Svg.CssFiles;
```

The same API's are also available in ServiceStack.Razor pages using the `@Html` helpers below:

```csharp
Html.SvgImage(name)
Html.SvgImage(name, fillColor)
Html.SvgDataUri(name)
Html.SvgDataUri(name, fillColor)
Html.SvgFill(svg, color);

Html.SvgBackgroundImageCss(name)
Html.SvgBackgroundImageCss(name, fillColor)
Html.SvgInBackgroundImageCss(svg)

Html.SvgBaseUrl()
```

### Mix in SVG Images

A nice consequence of the SVG support is being able to easily create a customized bundles of hand-picked SVG image assets
as opposed to being forced to choose from a limited library in a fixed bundle. 

As creating svg bundles just involves dropping SVG images inside your `/svg/{group}/` folder, we're also able take advantage of `mix`
to import SVG image-sets into your App with a single command. You can view the current list of all SVG image-sets on `mix` with:

    $ x mix [svg]

Currently all [Material Design Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline) are available separately by their logical group names:

```
Results matching tag [svg]:

   1. svg-action         Material Design Action Icons         to: svg/  by @ServiceStack  [svg]
   2. svg-alert          Material Design Alert Icons          to: svg/  by @ServiceStack  [svg]
   3. svg-av             Material Design Audio Visual Icons   to: svg/  by @ServiceStack  [svg]
   4. svg-communication  Material Design Communication Icons  to: svg/  by @ServiceStack  [svg]
   5. svg-content        Material Design Content Icons        to: svg/  by @ServiceStack  [svg]

  13. svg-places         Material Design Places Icons         to: svg/  by @ServiceStack  [svg]
  14. svg-social         Material Design Social Icons         to: svg/  by @ServiceStack  [svg]
  15. svg-toggle         Material Design Toggle Icons         to: svg/  by @ServiceStack  [svg]
```

Once imported, you have the flexibility to further customize them individually to create your App's custom designer bundle.
You also have access to `#Script` to generate parts of your SVG image dynamically if needed, as seen above in `spirals.html`.
