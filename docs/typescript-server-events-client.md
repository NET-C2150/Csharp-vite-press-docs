![ServiceStack and TypeScript Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/release-notes/servicestack-heart-typescript.png)

The TypeScript `ServerEventClient` is an idiomatic port of ServiceStack's 
[C# Server Events Client](/csharp-server-events-client) in native TypeScript providing a productive 
client to consume ServiceStack's [real-time Server Events](/server-events) that can be used in both 
TypeScript Web and node.js server applications.

## Install

`ServerEventClient` is available in the 
[@servicestack/client npm package](https://github.com/ServiceStack/servicestack-client) 
which is preconfigured in all [ServiceStackVS TypeScript VS.NET Templates](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStackVS)

npm based projects can install it with:

    npm install @servicestack/client

To configure Server Sent Events on the client create a new instance of `ServerEventsClient` with the
**baseUrl** and the **channels** you want to connect to, e.g:

```ts
const channels = ["home"];
const client = new ServerEventsClient("/", channels, {
    handlers: {
        onConnect: (sub:ServerEventConnect) => {  // Successful SSE connection
            console.log("You've connected! welcome " + sub.displayName);
        },
        onJoin: (msg:ServerEventJoin) => {        // User has joined subscribed channel
            console.log("Welcome, " + msg.displayName);
        },
        onLeave: (msg:ServerEventLeave) => {      // User has left subscribed channel
            console.log(msg.displayName + " has left the building");
        },
        onUpdate: (msg:ServerEventUpdate) => {    // User channel subscription was changed
            console.log(msg.displayName + " channels subscription were updated");
        },        
        onMessage: (msg:ServerEventMessage) => {} // Invoked for each other message
        //... Register custom handlers
        announce: (text:string) => {}             // Handle messages with simple argument
        chat: (chatMsg:ChatMessage) => {}         // Handle messages with complex type argument
        CustomMessage: (msg:CustomMessage) => {}  // Handle complex types with default selector
    },
    receivers: { 
        //... Register any receivers
        tv: {
            watch: function (id) {                // Handle 'tv.watch {url}' messages 
                var el = document.querySelector("#tv");
                if (id.indexOf('youtu.be') >= 0) {
                    var v = splitOnLast(id, '/')[1];
                    el.innerHTML = templates.youtube.replace("{id}", v);
                } else {
                    el.innerHTML = templates.generic.replace("{id}", id);
                }
                el.style.display = 'block'; 
            },
            off: function () {                    // Handle 'tv.off' messages
                var el = document.querySelector("#tv");
                el.style.display = 'none';
                el.innerHTML = '';
            }
        }
    },
    onException: (e:Error) => {},                 // Invoked on each Error
    onReconnect: (e:Error) => {}                  // Invoked after each auto-reconnect
})
.addListener("theEvent",(e:ServerEventMessage) => {}) // Add listener for pub/sub event trigger
.start();                                             // Start listening for Server Events!
```

> If hosted from same ServiceStack Instance, the relative `/` url can be used instead of the absolute `baseUrl` 

### Message Events

ServiceStack Server Events has 4 built-in events sent during a subscriptions life-cycle: 

 - **onConnect** - sent when successfully connected, includes the subscriptions private `subscriptionId` as well as heartbeat and unregister urls that's used to automatically setup periodic heartbeats
 - **onJoin** - sent when a new user joins the channel
 - **onLeave** - sent when a user leaves the channel
 - **onUpdate** - sent when a user's channels subscription was updated

> The onJoin/onLeave/onUpdate events can be turned off with `ServerEventsFeature.NotifyChannelOfSubscriptions=false`.

All other messages can be handled with the catch-all:

 - **onMessage** - fired when any other message is sent

### Server Event Client Events

Other top-level events the `ServerEventClient` fires that can be handled include: 

 - **onException** - Invoked on each error the client receives
 - **onReconnect** - Invoked after each time the client had to auto-reconnect
 - **onTick** - Invoked after any event or state change

## Selectors

A selector is a string that identifies what should handle the message, it's used by the client to route the message to different handlers. The client bindings supports 4 different handlers out of the box:

### Global Event Handlers

The easiest way to handle a custom event is to define a handler, e.g:

```ts
const client = new ServerEventsClient("/", channels, {
    handlers: {
        paint: (color:string) => {
            this.style.background = color;
        },
        chat: (chatMsg:ChatMessage, e:ServerEventMessage) => {
        }
    }
}).start();
```

The selector to invoke a global event handler is:

    cmd.{handler} {message}

Which can be sent in ServiceStack with:

```csharp
ServerEvents.NotifyChannel(channel, "cmd.paint", "green");
ServerEvents.NotifyChannel(channel, "cmd.chat", new ChatMessage { ... });
```

Where `{handler}` is the name of the handler you want to invoke, e.g `cmd.paint`. When invoked from a server event the message (deserialized from JSON) is the first argument, the Server Sent DOM Event is the 2nd argument and `this` by default is assigned to `document.body`.

```ts
function paint(msg /* JSON object msg */, e /*ServerEventMessage*/){
    this // HTML Element or document.body
    this.style.background = "green";
}
```

#### Handling Messages with the Default Selector

All `IServerEvents` Notify API's includes [overloads for sending messages without a selector](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/ServerEventsFeature.cs#L743-L771) that by convention will take the format `cmd.{TypeName}`. 

As they're prefixed with `cmd.*` these events can be handled with a handler **based on Message type name**, e.g:

```ts
const client = new ServerEventsClient("/", channels, {
    handlers: {
        CustomType: (msg:CustomType) => { ... },
        SetterType: (msg:SetterType, e:ServerEventMessage) => { ... }
    }
}).start();
```

Which will be called when messages are sent without a selector, e.g:

```csharp
public class MyServices : Service
{
    public IServerEvents ServerEvents { get; set; }

    public void Any(Request request)
    {
        ServerEvents.NotifyChannel("home", new CustomType { ... });
        ServerEvents.NotifyChannel("home", new SetterType { ... });
    }
}
```

### Postfix CSS selector 

All server event handler options also support a postfix CSS selector for specifying what each handler should be bound to with a `$` followed by the CSS selector, e.g:

    cmd.{handler}${cssSelector}

A concrete example for calling the above API would be:

    cmd.paintGreen$#btnPaint

Which will bind `this` to the `#btnSubmit` HTML Element.

> Note: Spaces in CSS selectors need to be encoded with `%20`

### Modifying CSS

As it's a popular use-case Server Events also has native support for modifying CSS properties with:

    css.{propertyName}${cssSelector} {propertyValue}

Where the message is the property value, which roughly translates to:

    document.querySelectorAll({cssSelector}).style[{propertyName}] = {propertyValue}

When no CSS selector is specified it falls back to `document.body` by default.

    css.background #eceff1

Some other examples include:

    css.background$#top #673ab7   // $('#top').css('background','#673ab7')
    css.font$li bold 12px verdana // $('li').css('font','bold 12px verdana')
    css.visibility$a,img hidden   // $('a,img').css('visibility','#673ab7')
    css.visibility$a%20img hidden // $('a img').css('visibility','hidden')

### Receivers

In programming languages based on message-passing like Smalltalk and Objective-C invoking a method is done by sending a message to a receiver. This is conceptually equivalent to invoking a method on an instance in C# where both these statements are roughly equivalent:

```objc
// Objective-C
[receiver method:argument]
```

```csharp
// C#
receiver.method(argument)
```

Support for receivers is available in the following format:

    {receiver}.{target} {msg}

### Registering Receivers

Registering a receiver can be done with a map of the object instance and the name you want it to be exported as. E.g. The `window` and `document` global objects can be setup to receive messages with:

```ts
const client = new ServerEventsClient("/", channels, {
    receivers: {
        "window": window, 
        "document": document 
    }
}).start();
```

Alternatively you can add receivers at runtime with:

```ts
const client = new ServerEventsClient("/", channels)
    .registerNamedReceiver("window", window);
    .registerNamedReceiver("document", document)
    .start();
```

Once registered you can set any property or call any method on a receiver with:

    document.title New Window Title
    window.location http://google.com

Where if `{target}` was a function it will be invoked with the message, otherwise its property will be set.
By default when no `{cssSelector}` is defined, `this` is bound to the **receiver** instance.

Example of setting up a custom receiver:

```ts
const client = new ServerEventsClient("/", channels, {
    receivers: {
        tv: {
            watch: function (id) {
                var el = document.querySelector("#tv");
                if (id.indexOf('youtu.be') >= 0) {
                    var v = splitOnLast(id, '/')[1];
                    el.innerHTML = templates.youtube.replace("{id}", v);
                } else {
                    el.innerHTML = templates.generic.replace("{id}", id);
                }
                el.style.display = 'block'; 
            },
            off: function () {
                var el = document.querySelector("#tv");
                el.style.display = 'none';
                el.innerHTML = '';
            }
        }
    }
}).start();
```

This registers a custom `tv` receiver that can now be called with:

    tv.watch http://youtu.be/518XP8prwZo
    tv.watch https://servicestack.net/img/logo-220.png
    tv.off

### Receiver Constructors

In addition to registering an object instance as a receiver, you can also specify a `class` 
(aka constructor Function) instead, e.g:

```ts
class CssReceiver {
    backgroundImage(url:string) {
        document.body.style.backgroundImage = url;
    }
}

const client = new ServerEventsClient("/", channels, {
    receivers: {
        css: CssReceiver
    }
}).start();
```

Which will invoke `backgroundImage` method off a new instance of the `CssReceiver` class that's triggered with:

    css.background-image url(https://bit.ly/1yIJOBH)

and can be sent to all subscriptions on the **home** channel in ServiceStack with:

```csharp
ServerEvents.NotifyChannel("home", "css.background-image", "url(https://bit.ly/1yIJOBH)");
```

This works the same with Global Receivers, in addition Receivers can extend `ServerEventReceiver`:

```ts
class ServerEventReceiver implements IReceiver {
    public client: ServerEventsClient;
    public request: ServerEventMessage;
    noSuchMethod(selector: string, message:any) {}
}
```

To access additional built-in functionality where it will allow receivers to access the `ServerEventsClient` 
client dependency, the `ServerEventMessage` that was received, it also lets you handle any unhandled messages 
sent by implementing `noSuchMethod()`, e.g:

```ts
class JavaScriptReceiver extends ServerEventReceiver {

    chatMessage(msg: ChatMessage) {
        let request = new LogMessage();
        request.channel = msg.channel;
        request.message = msg.message;

        this.client.serviceClient.post(request)
            .then(r => {
                console.log(`logged ${msg.message} sent by ${msg.fromName} to ${msg.channel}`);
            });
    }
    
    announce(message:string) {
        alert(message);
    }

    toggle() {
        let el = document.querySelector(this.request.cssSelector);
        el.style.display = el.style.display != "none" ? "none" : "block";
    }

    noSuchMethod(selector:string, message:ServerEventMessage) {
        console.log(`Unhandled ${selector} was sent message: `, message);
    }
}

client.registerReceiver(JavaScriptReceiver); //register Global Receiver
```

These can triggered with:

```csharp
ServerEvents.NotifyChannel(channel, new ChatMessage { ... });
ServerEvents.NotifyChannel(channel, "cmd.announce", "Hello, World!");
ServerEvents.NotifyChannel(channel, "cmd.toggle$#sidebar");
ServerEvents.NotifyChannel(channel, "cmd.UnknownSelector", new Message { ... });
```

### Dependency Resolvers

You can control the lifetime of the receivers by injecting a custom resolver which will let you reuse the same
Receiver instance by using a `SingletonInstanceResolver`, e.g:

```ts
const client = new ServerEventsClient("/", channels)
    .setResolver(new SingletonInstanceResolver())
    .registerReceiver(JavaScriptReceiver)
    .start();
```

Which is implemented with:

```ts
export class SingletonInstanceResolver implements IResolver {
    tryResolve(ctor:ObjectConstructor): any {
        return (ctor as any).instance 
            || ((ctor as any).instance = new ctor());
    }
}
```

### Un Registering a Receiver

As receivers are maintained in a simple map, they can be disabled at anytime with:

```ts
client.unregisterReceiver("window");
```

and re-enabled with:

```ts
client.registerNamedReceiver("window", window);
```

Whilst Named Receivers are used to handle messages sent to a specific namespaced selector, the client also supports registering a **Global Receiver** for handling messages sent with the special `cmd.*` selector.

### Event Triggers

Triggers enable a pub/sub event model where multiple listeners can subscribe and be notified of an event.

Registering an event handler can be done at anytime using the `addListener()` API, e.g:

```ts
const handler = (e:ServerEventMessage) => {
    console.log(`received event ${e.target} with arg: ${JSON.parse(e.json)}`);
}

const client = new ServerEventsClient("/", channels)
    .addListener("customEvent", handler)
    .start();

//Register another listener to 'customEvent' event
client.addListener("customEvent", e => { ... });
```

The selector to trigger this custom event is:

    trigger.customEvent arg
    trigger.customEvent {json}

Which can be sent in ServiceStack with a simple or complex type argument, e.g:

```ts
ServerEvents.NotifyChannel(channel, "trigger.customEvent", "arg");
ServerEvents.NotifyChannel(channel, "trigger.customEvent", new ChatMessage { ... });
```

#### Removing Listeners

Use `removeListener()` to stop listening for an event, e.g:

```ts
//Remove first event listener
client.removeListener("customEvent", handler);
```

### Channel Subscriber APIs

You can use any of the APIs below to update an active Subscriptions Channels:

```ts
client.subscribeToChannels("chan3","chan4");
client.unsubscribeFromChannels("chan1","chan2");

//Alternatively subscribe/unsubscribe to channels in the same request with:
var request = new UpdateEventSubscriber();
request.subscribeChannels = ["chan3","chan4"];
request.unsubscribeChannels = ["chan1","chan2"];
client.updateSubscriber(request);
```

### Get Channel Subscribers

Once connected, you can get a list of channel subscribers the `ServerEventsClient` is currently connected
to with:

```ts
client.getChannelSubscribers()
    .then(users => users.forEach(x => 
        console.log(`#${x.userId} @${x.displayName} ${x.profileUrl} ${x.channels}`)));
```

### Accessing ServiceClient

Alternatively you can access the channel subscribers using the built-in `JsonServiceClient`, e.g:

```ts
let request = new GetEventSubscribers();
request.channels = ["chan1","chan2"];

client.serviceClient.get(request)
    .then(r => ...);
```

Which you can also use to call your own Services:

```ts
client.serviceClient.post(new MyRequest())
    .then(r => ...)
```

## Authentication via JWT

As the TypeScript `ServerEventsClient` needs to use the browsers native EventSource class to establish the SSE connection it's not able to customize 
the HTTP Request Headers in other clients but as the client shares the same cookies with the browser you can use a JWT Token Cookie either
by Requesting to use a [JWT Token Cookie at Authentication](/jwt-authprovider#request-jwt-cookie-is-set-on-authentication) or by setting the Token
Cookie on the client, [CORS permitting](/corsfeature), e.g:

```js
document.cookie = "ss-tok={Token}";
```

Alternatively you can enable authenticating via JWT on the QueryString:

### Send JWTs in HTTP Params

The JWT Auth Provider can **opt-in** to accept JWT's via the Query String or HTML POST FormData with:

```csharp
new JwtAuthProvider {
    AllowInQueryString = true,
    AllowInFormData = true
}
```

This is useful for situations where it's not possible to attach the JWT in the HTTP Request Headers or `ss-tok` Cookie. 

For example if you wanted to authenticate via JWT to a real-time [Server Events stream](/server-events) from a token retrieved from a remote auth server (i.e. so the JWT Cookie isn't already configured with the SSE server) you can [call the /session-to-token API](/jwt-authprovider#ajax-clients) to convert the JWT Bearer Token into a JWT Cookie which will configure it with that domain so the subsequent HTTP Requests to the SSE event stream contains the JWT cookie and establishes an authenticated session:

```ts
var client = new JsonServiceClient(BaseUrl);
client.setBearerToken(JWT);
await client.post(new ConvertSessionToToken());

var sseClient = new ServerEventsClient(BaseUrl, ["*"], {
    handlers: {
        onConnect: e => { 
            console.log(e.isAuthenticated /*true*/, e.userId, e.displayName);
        }
    }
}).start();
```

Unfortunately this wont work in `node.exe` Server Apps (or in integration tests) which doesn't support a central location for configuring domain cookies. One solution that works everywhere is to add the JWT to the `?ss-tok` query string that's used to connect to the `/event-stream` URL, e.g:

```csharp
var sseClient = new ServerEventsClient(BaseUrl, ["*"], {
    resolveStreamUrl: url => appendQueryString(url, { "ss-tok": JWT }),
    handlers: {
        onConnect: e => { 
            console.log(e.isAuthenticated /*true*/, e.userId, e.displayName);
        }
    }
}).start();
```
