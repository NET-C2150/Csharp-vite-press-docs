If you're completely new to ServiceStack, the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0kXKGVU4NHcwNdDdRiAJSA/videos) is a great way to explore some of the possibilities easily enabled with ServiceStack:

## Explore ServiceStack Apps

A great way to learn new technology is to explore existing Apps built with it, where for ServiceStack you can find a number of simple focused Apps at:

### [.NET Core Apps](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/LiveDemos)

### [.NET Framework Apps](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/LiveDemos#live-servicestack-demos)

### [Sharp Apps](https://sharpscript.net/sharp-apps/app-index)

Many Apps are well documented like [World Validation](/world-validation) which covers how to re-implement a simple Contacts App UI in 
**10 popular Web Development approaches** - all calling the same ServiceStack Services. 

ServiceStack is a single code-base implementation that supports [.NET's most popular Server platforms](/why-servicestack#multiple-hosting-options) with
near perfect source-code [compatibility with .NET Core](/netcore) so all .NET Frameworks Apps are still relevant in .NET Core, e.g. 
the [EmailContacts guidance](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/EmailContacts) walks through the recommended setup and physical layout structure of typical medium-sized ServiceStack projects, including complete documentation of how to create the solution from scratch, whilst explaining all the ServiceStack features it makes use of along the way.

### Sharp Apps

[Sharp Apps](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-apps) are a revolutionary new approach to dramatically simplify .NET Web App development with the 
ultimate simplicity of being able to develop Apps in real-time while it's running & never needing to build or re-compile Apps. Their inherent simplicity
makes it possible to build [Gist Desktop Apps](https://sharpscript.net/docs/gist-desktop-apps) they can be **run on-the-fly without installation** 
and can be [deployed without CI or published assets](https://sharpscript.net/docs/deploying-sharp-apps) and updated 
[with a single command](https://sharpscript.net/docs/deploying-sharp-apps).
